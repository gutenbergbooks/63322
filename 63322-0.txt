To the Reader.


_The substance of the philosophical part of this discourse was
delivered at twice to the Royal Society, on_ March 15, _and_ 22: _The
theological, in my own church. I could not refuse the solicitation of my
friends, hearers in both places, to print it. I wish my intention, in
the compliance, may any ways prove successful; to show, how vain, and
unmeaning, are all our philosophical inquiries, when destitute of their
true view; to lead us into the more engaging paths of religion. That,
from speculation of material causes, we may become adepts in that wisdom
which is from above. Otherwise, like_ Epicurus, _and the ancient heathen
philosophers, we barter away our immortal part, for a curiosity, that
amuses us to no good purpose. Mean are these objects of our senses to be
accounted, in comparison of our spiritual natures, to which our principal
regard is due! For we must rightly say with_ Job: Lo, these are parts of
God's ways, but how little a portion is heard of him? and the thunder of
his power, who can understand?

                       _Martin Folkes_, Esq; LL.D.

                     President of the Royal Society.


                                                         _March 26, 1750._

When so great and unusual a _phenomenon_, as an earthquake, and that
repeated, happens among us; it will naturally excite a serious reflection
in everyone that is capable of thinking. And we cannot help considering
it, both in a philosophical and a religious view. Any mind will take the
alarm when we perceive a motion that affects the earth, that bears the
whole city of _London_, and some miles round it. And at the same time
while it gives us so sensible a shake, so gently sets us down again;
without damage to any buildings, and without a life lost.

'Tis hard to say, which is the greater wonder. But alas in the works
of nature, there are no degrees of great, and little; comparisons are
incompatible. We indeed are more affected with what seems great in our
own apprehensions: I would rather say, what is rare and unusual. An
omnipotent power admits of no distinctions. And when prodigious effects
are produc'd from causes imperceptible, it rightly claims our most serious
attention, as well as wonder. Nor need we lose sight of the theological
purpose of these amazing alarms; whilst we endeavor to find out the
philosophy of them.

Among all the appearances of nature, which are the subject of the
inquiries of the Royal Society, none more deserves the regard of a
contemplative mind. And among the very numerous accounts received there,
from all quarters, being only Observations upon the manner of it, and
its extent: I judg'd, it became us to inquire into the _cause_ of so
extraordinary a motion: of which we could not form a proper idea; had we
not repeatedly seen, and felt it.

The moderns have not improv'd upon the opinions of the ancients, in
this matter; any further than by the fancied analogy of some chymical
experiments. But these chymical experiments, and all sorts of explosions
by gun-powder, and the like, are to me a very unsatisfactory solution
they are merely artificial compositions, which can have nothing similar
in the bowels of the earth, and they produce their effects by violence,
by rending and tearing, by a _solutio continui_. This is indeed too
often the case of earthquakes, but _that_ is a partial degree, not
at all equivalent to the compass of the shock; and is very far from
being the constant concomitant of an earthquake. Quite the contrary.
Innumerable such happen, when there is no breach of the surface; and of
these three or four which we have now felt, nothing of it has appear'd.
But the immensity of the vibration of the earth which shook every house
in _London_, with impunity, and for twenty miles round, can never, in
my apprehension, be owing to so unbridled a cause, as any subterraneous
vapours, fermentations, rarefactions, and the like; the vulgar solution.
Nor does the kind of motion, which I discern in an earthquake, in any sort
agree with what we should expect from explosions.

In order then to proceed with some degree of certainty, in our inquiry
after the cause of earthquakes, it will be useful, in the first place,
to set in one view, the general appearances remarkable therein; the most
usual concomitants: As we can collect them from our own observation, or
from the relations and writings of others.


Circumstances.

I. That earthquakes always happen in calm seasons, in warm, dry, sultry
weather; or after a dry, frosty air.

II. That they are felt at sea, as well as land, even in the main ocean;
and at that time, the sea is calm.

III. That earthquakes differ very much in magnitude. Some shake a very
large tract of country, at the same instant of time; nay, sometime extend
to very many countries, separated by mountains, seas, lakes, the ocean.

IV. That earthquakes differ very much in the quantity, of their vibratory
motion: Whence in some, tho' largely extended, they are innocuous; in
others, both small and great, they lay all in ruin and destruction.

V. That a hollow, thundering, unusual noise accompanies them, or rather
seems to preceed the shock; which rolls in the air like the noise of
cannon.

VI. That they are felt more sensibly in the upper story of houses than in
the lower.

VII. That the shock is more violent upon more solid buildings, churches,
castles, and stone-houses, than upon those of slighter materials.

VIII. That many people find themselves sick at stomach, with headake, and
pains in their joints, and the like, which sometime lasts for the day
after, or longer.

IX. That earthquakes generally happen to great towns, and cities, and more
particularly to those that are situate on the sea.

X. That earthquakes do not cause any damage to springs and fountains; but
the water in wells becomes foul for a short time.

XI. That they are more frequent in the neighboring countries of a vulcano.

This last circumstance, in my opinion, has led all inquirers in this
question, out of the true path; therefore I propose in the ensuing paper.

I. To shew what it is not; the insufficiency of the vulgar opinion, of
subterraneous fires and vapours.

II. To shew what it is in reality, as it appears to me.

III. I shall conclude with the moral use we ought to make of these
prodigies of nature.

I. The struggles of subterraneous winds and fires, that should heave
up the ground like animal convulsions, seem to me impossible: Their
powers, and manner of acting (if such there be) is quite incapable of
producing the appearance of an earthquake. That these should operate
instantaneously, in one minute, thro' a circle of 30 or 40 miles diameter,
or more, I could not conceive. Nor that there should be any possible, much
less ready passage thro' the solid earth, for such nimble agents, as every
one is apt to imagine that speak of this appearance; without sufficiently
reflecting on the insuperable difficulties in that _hypothesis_.

We cannot pretend to deny that there may be such vapours, and
fermentations, inflammable substances, and actual fires, in the bowels of
the earth; and that there may be some caverns under-ground, as well as we
find some few above ground: such as _Pool_'s-_Hole_, _The Devil_'s-_Arse
in the Peak_ of _Derbyshire_, and _Okey-Hole_ in _Somersetshire_.
These, I believe, to have been so from the creation, never were made by
earthquakes. We know, there are hot springs running continually: There
are some vulcano's frequently belching out flames and smoke, and to these
perhaps some earthquakes may be owing, tho' not according to the vulgar
notion; as we shall see, by and by.

But these matters are very rare, much rarer than earthquakes, both as to
time and place. _Vesuvius_ in _Italy_, and in that part of it abounding
with mines of sulphur: _Ã†tna_ in _Sicily_, and _Heckla_ in _Iceland_;
these are all we know of, in the old world. In the _Andes_ mountains of
_America_, there are some. The scarcity of these appears to me a strong
argument against the common deductions made therefrom, as to their being
the cause of earthquakes.

Nor can I enter into the sentiments of those that hold the cavernous
state of the earth, so as to contribute to the forming an earthquake by
vapours running from place to place under ground. How many thousand acres
of coal-mines do they daily work in _England_, and have done for ages? I
have been myself 2 or 300 feet deep in a solid rock of native salt: I have
walked a mile lengthwise directly into the earth, and descending all the
way, in the proportion of one yard in five, 'till we came under the bed of
the very ocean, where ships were sailing over our heads. This was at Sir
_James Lowther_'s coal-pit, at _Whitehaven_. We were at this time deeper
under ground by the perpendicular, than any part of the ocean, between
_England_ and _Ireland_.

We never hear, from the many hundreds of thousands of workmen in this
kind, at _Newcastle_, _Nottinghamshire_, _Yorkshire_, _Derbyshire_,
_Staffordshire_, _Somersetshire_, and _Wales_: from the infinite numbers
of workmen in the mines of lead, tin, and the like, of the cavernous
state of the earth, so as to give any colour for this _hypothesis_ of
earthquakes. The earth is generally of solid rock; in which there must be
now, and then, some clefts, and vacuities, small in compass, as naturally
so many heterogeneous _strata_ of the earth consolidate together. But
there can be no imagination of vapours breaking through, uniting,
traversing so suddenly, a large space of earth, so as to produce those
earthquakes, we have seen, and felt; much less such as we read of. The
workmen in all sorts of mines confess by their hard labor, that the earth
is not cavernous; nor are there mines of sulphur, nitre, and the like
inflammable materials in _England_. Or if there were, could they burn,
and cause convulsions of the earth, without proper cavities, pipes, and
conveyances of air; as vulcano's, and coal-pits, when set on fire. But
even from these coal-pits, when fired, do we ever find any thing like
an earthquake produced. Nor do we find earthquakes frequent in those
countries, that abound with coal-mines, as certainly would be the case,
if that _hypothesis_ was just. How easy would it be, on the slightest
occasion for earthquakes to happen in the countries abounding with
coal-mines, which are so full of artificial cavities communicating with
one another, for many miles together: The very thing supposed, by those
who hold the old opinion, of vapours traversing the earth for that purpose.

In the coal-pits, some small natural cavities now and then are found;
which when opened, send forth a pestiferous vapor and a fire-damp which
runs for a long time together. And tho' there are many substances that
may generate air, within the bowels of the earth; yet these matters are
infinitely unable to produce an earthquake: Never would have force to open
a passage for themselves thro' the solid rock, of perhaps many hundred
feet in thickness. Nor did we observe in these last earthquakes any fire,
vapour, smoke, or smell, any kind of eruption, in the least; as must
certainly have been, in so great a struggle of the superfice, as affected
a circle of so large a diameter. Were there such, we could scarce hope any
otherwise, than that they would be too sensibly felt; to the destruction
of many thousands, by their pestiferous qualities.

Indeed this consideration alone, of the extent of that surface, is
sufficient to overthrow any supposition, of earthquakes being chiefly
owing to subterraneous vapours: They cannot momentarily fly under so large
a tract of ground, if they were near the outward shell of the earth. They
could not do it without breaking ground, and discovering themselves to
the sight, or smell; and that for a long time after. It cannot possibly
be imagin'd, they could have so immense a force, as to lift up the city
of _London_, and never be perceived by our organs, and outward senses. We
have frequent accounts of a little fire-ball bursting in the air, at a
distance; yet it instantly propagates a sulphureous smell around.

If the movement of a superficies of 30 miles diameter was owing to fumes,
and vapours; we ought reasonably to find some great discharges of them,
belching out smoke and fire, for a long time after, like vulcano's,
and coal-pits fir'd. The operation of the shock ought to be of hours
continuance, not instantaneous; and the evaporation of so vast a quantity
of matter, must darken the whole region of the air for a long time
after; or require a long time, if gradually it discharges itself. We see
how immense a volume of smoke is produc'd by a very small quantity of
gun-powder; and no vapour could be so subtle, that produc'd such effects,
and not be very obvious to our senses.

Even in vulcano's, it is the opinion of the learned _Italian_ philosopher
_Borelli_, and of other great naturalists, that they are kindled first
from the surface, where there is a possibility of ventilation from the
air. They imagine, it begins at the top of the mountains; not by any
fancied fermentation of the _pyrites_ and sulphureous vapours arising from
subterraneous caverns, in the lower parts of mountains.

There is another consideration, which utterly overthrows these
suppositions, of earthquakes being caused by anything under-ground; and
that is a due consideration of springs, and fountains perpetually flowing;
and that from the creation of the world to this day. If we would form any
tolerable idea of their nature, we must needs conceive, that God Almighty
has laid their pipes, and canals in the earth, from a great depth, even to
the surface; like as he has planted the veins, arteries, and glands in an
animal body. And likewise that they are more and more ramify'd, as they
nearer approach the outward shell of the earth; just so our veins, and
arteries, as they come nearer the skin.

The workmen in coal-mines, and those of metals, minerals, and
stone-quarries, never fail to meet with springs, and currents of water,
every where. Often they ruin, and divert springs another way, only by
digging into the earth for foxes, and the like. Whenever they dig for
wells, in any kind of earth, they commonly find springs. The colliers,
and workers of mines, are oblig'd to drain the waters off with very great
expence.

These are circumstances not favorable to subterraneous fires being in the
earth in abundance; much less to their being the cause of earthquakes.
And further, we cannot possibly think of earthquakes doing their work
that way, without absolutely ruining the whole system of springs, and
fountains, throughout the whole country, where they pass. But all this is
quite contrary to fact; even where an earthquake has been repeatedly. For
an instance from home.

On _Wednesday, April_ 6, 1580, about six in the evening, just such another
earthquake was felt in _London_ and around it, as these two we have seen.
Another exactly similar 1692. In all these four, no houses thrown down, no
springs disturb'd thereby, no sensible eruptions nor smells.

These considerations I apply only to this little inconsiderable space,
of a circle 30 miles diameter; as with us. But what is that to the
earthquakes we read of in history? In the year of our Lord 17, no less
than thirteen great and noble cities in _Asia minor_, were destroyed in
one night. _Tacitus_, _Pliny_, and many other authors mention it. The fact
is so notorious, that some persons here present, have seen a vast block of
white marble now standing near _Naples_; being the pedestal of a coloss
statue of _Tiberius_ the emperor; having carv'd on it the _genius's_, or
pictures of all those cities, with their names. The accurate _Bulifon_ and
others have wrote treatises upon it. These cities were rebuilt by that
emperor. But without going so far, we may see another evidence of it, a
coin of that emperor struck upon the occasion, with this inscription,

                      CIVITATIBUS ASIAE RESTITUTIS.

I have one of them, in large brass, which was found at _Colchester_.

The compass of this earthquake may be reckon'd to take up 300 miles
diameter, as a circle. Now, we cannot conceive, how any subterraneous
vapour can produce such an effect, as instantaneously to demolish all
these cities; and that such an accident should never happen after.
That the whole country of _Asia minor_ should not at the same time be
destroy'd, its mountains be renversed, its fountains, springs, and rivers
broken up and ruin'd for ever. Instead whereof we find nothing suffered,
but those cities; no kind of alteration in the surface of the country;
it remains the same as it were in the beginning of time. In 1586 an
earthquake in _Peru_, that extended 900 miles.

From these considerations, I cannot persuade myself, to enter into the
opinion of vapours, and eruptions being the cause sought for; and, after
we have treated the argument in a superficial view, we must go a little
deeper.

If we would consider things like philosophers, let us propose to ourselves
this problem: Where is the power to be plac'd, that is requir'd to move a
surface of earth 30 miles in diameter?

To answer this, consult the ingineers, and those that make mines in the
sieges of towns; they will acquaint us, that the effect of mines is
produced in form of an inverted cone. And that a diameter of 30 miles, in
the base, will require an _axis_ of 15 or 20 miles to operate upon that
base, so as to shake it, at least. Now the vapours, or whatever power we
propose to operate, according to the foregoing requisite, in order to form
the appearance of an earthquake, must be 15 or 20 miles deep in the earth.
But what mind can conceive, that any natural power is able to move an
inverted cone of solid earth, whose base is 30 miles diameter, whose axis
20? or was it possible; would not the whole texture of that body of earth
be quite disturb'd and shatter'd, especially in regard to its springs and
fountains? but nothing like this is ever found to be the consequence of an
earthquake, tho' fatal to cities.

Apply this reasoning to the earthquake of _Asia minor_, and this vigorous
principle at the _apex_ of the cone must lie, at least, 200 Miles deep in
the ground. Enough to show the absurdity of any moving power plac'd under
the Earth! A cone of 300 miles diameter at base, 200 miles _axis_: I dare
be bold to say, that all the gun-powder made since its invention, if put
together and fired, would not be able to move it; how much less pent up
vapours? what must we say of a circle of 900 miles diameter?

But, could that be admitted as possible, would any one be persuaded,
that such a subterraneous tumult, of so vast an extent, will be no ways
injurious to the internal system of springs and fountains, and that this
shall often be repeated without the least damage? We may as well imagine,
that we can stab a man 100 times and never touch vein or artery.

Since I gave in my two papers to the Royal Society, a letter of Mr.
_Flamsted_'s has been printed, which abundantly confirms my sentiments.
The whole drift of it is, to show how invalid is the vulgar idea
conceiv'd, of earthquakes arising from subterraneous vapours and
eruptions: That the earth itself is not moved to any depth, and that the
shock must arise from the atmosphere. The circumstances which he has
judiciously collected, are extremely agreeable to mine; many of them the
very same, strongly confirming my _hypothesis_: And had that great man
known the properties of electricity, which we are now masters of, he would
have prevented me in this affair.

"Considering (says he) what variety of substances, sand, gravel, stones,
rock, minerals, clay, and mold, our earth is compounded of, and how little
nitre, or explosive matter, a large quantity thereof will afford; I cannot
think, where we can find matter enough to move so vast a bulk of earth,
as all the South parts of _England_, all the _Netherlands_, with part
of _Germany_, all _France_, and perhaps _Italy_, (which were shock'd at
once the 8th of _September_ last 1692;) or part of _Asia_, and near all
_Europe_, which trembled together the same day, 91 years before.

"But, allowing there may have been sufficient matter prepared for these
purposes, I can hardly think, there are continued cavities, at any
reasonable depth, all under _Europe_, wherein an explosion being made,
might shake the whole at once, and yet make no clefts, or separations,
in those parts where the minerals and mountainous rocks part from the
light mold and clay. If an hundred barrels of gun-powder could be fixed
in some cave, a thousand yards under ground; allowing the force of the
explosion sufficient to raise all the weight of earth incumbent on the
cavern; it would certainly break the loose mold from any large solid rock
we may conceive adjacent, and leave at least some clefts behind it. But we
seldom or never hear of such clefts, made in such places, when earthquakes
happen."

Again, he writes thus: "I cannot apprehend, (if all earthquakes must
be made by explosions in subterraneous caverns) why sometimes a large
country, or whole continent, should be thereby shook all at once; why
there should be no eruptions in the neighbourhood?"

From all circumstances consider'd, he concludes, that the abstruse,
effective cause of them comes from the air; and that a calm is necessary
before an earthquake. And these two particulars are likewise Dr. _Hales_'s
positions: "The earth-lightning, as he calls it, is first kindled on the
surface, and not at great depths, as has been thought; whose explosion is
the immediate cause of an earthquake. He says, long, dry, hot seasons,
are usually the preparatory forerunners of earthquakes." From all these
considerations I conclude; earthquakes are not caus'd by subterraneous
vapors.

II. We are to inquire, what is the cause of earthquakes.

In an age when electricity has been so much our entertainment, and our
amazement; when we are become so well acquainted with its stupendous
powers and properties, its velocity, and instantaneous operation through
any given distance; when we see, upon a touch, or an approach, between
a non-electric and an electrified body, what a wonderful vibration is
produc'd! what a snap it gives! how an innocuous flame breaks forth!
how violent a shock! Is it to be wonder'd at, that hither we turn our
thoughts, for the solution of the prodigious appearance of an earthquake?

Here is at once an assemblage of all those properties and circumstances
which we so often see in courses of electricity. Electricity may be call'd
a sort of soul to matter, thought to be an ethereal fire pervading all
things; and acting instantaneously, where, and as far as it is excited.
'Tis every body's observation, that there never was a winter, like the
last past, in any one's memory, so extremely remarkable for warmth and
driness, abounding with thunder and lightning, very uncommon in winter;
coruscations in the air frequent, justly thought electrical by all
philosophers; particularly, twice we had the extraordinary appearance of
that called _aurora australis_, with colours altogether unusual; and this
just before the first earthquake: All the while the wind constantly south
and south-west, and that without rain, which is unusual with these winds.

This state of the atmosphere had continued five months before the first
earthquake. Is it not hence reasonable to conclude, that the earth,
especially in our region, must be brought into an unusual state of
electricity; into that vibratory condition wherein electricity consists;
and, consequently, nothing was wanting but the approach of a non-electric
body, to produce that snap, and that shock, which we call an earthquake; a
vibration of the superficies of the earth.

That the earth was in that vibratory and electric state we have further
reason to conclude, from the very extraordinary forwardness of all the
vegetable world with us. Every one knows, that, at the end of _February_,
all sorts of garden-stuff, trees, fruits, and flowers, were as forward
as in other years, by the middle of _April_. Conformable to which,
experiments abundantly show, that electrifying of plants quickens their
growth, equally as in animals it quickens the pulse. Nor will the unusual
driness and warmth of the weather solely account for such a precipitate
vegetation: because a necessary supply of rain was wanting, as in the
natural Spring-season.

A very long dry frost will produce the same electrical state of the earth,
as it equally favours electrical experiments. Thus, _March_ 27, 1076,
a frost from the 1st of _November_ to the middle of _April_, a general
earthquake in _England_ succeeded. _Matt. Paris._ That of _Oxford_, 17th
of _September_ 1683, was after a frost. _Jan._ 4, 1680, An earthquake in
_Somersetshire_: The air was very calm; a frosty night.

Mr. _Flamsted_ concurs with us, in our first position, That earthquakes
always happen in _calm_ seasons. He adds, "That _Keckerman_, a learned
author, who wrote on the subject, affirms, and backs it from the authority
of _Aristotle_ and _Pliny_."

The 8th of _September_ 1601 was a very calm day but cloudy: And the
_Smyrna_ merchants observe the earthquakes there happen in calm, still
weather. The remarkable clearness and calmness of the morning was observed
in that of _Oxford_ 17th of _September_ 1683, and the air continued
so for five or six days after: Therefore we may infer, that it is not
impossible, what has been abundantly related, that some foreigners
from _Italy_ here in _England_, some from the _West-Indies_ (in both
which countries earthquakes are more frequent than with us) did seem to
apprehend our first earthquakes from the apparent temper of the weather;
and observations of this kind are as old as _Aristotle_. It is observed
in _Jamaica_, when the air is extraordinary calm, an earthquake is always
apprehended.

We had lately read at the Royal Society, a very curious discourse, from
Mr. _Franklin_ of _Philadelphia_, concerning thundergusts, lightning,
the northern lights, and meteors. All which he rightly solves from the
doctrine of electricity. For, if a cloud raised from the sea, which is
a non-electric, happens to touch a cloud raised from exhalations of the
land, when electrified, it must immediately cause thunder and lightning.
The electrical fire flowing from the touch of perhaps a thousand miles
compass of clouds, makes that appearance, which we call lightning. The
snap which we hear in our electrical experiments, when re-echoed from
cloud to cloud, the extent of the firmament, makes that affrightning sound
of thunder.

From the same principle I infer, that, if a non-electric cloud discharges
its contents upon any part of the earth, when in a high electrified state,
an earthquake must necessarily ensue. The ship made upon the contact of
many miles compass of solid earth is that horrible uncouth noise, which
we hear upon an earthquake; and the shock is the earthquake itself.

In the relation received from _Portsmouth_, and the _Isle of Wight_,
concerning the last shock there, on the 18th of _March_, the writer
observes, the Day was warm and serene; but, upon a gentle shower falling
in the evening, the earthquake came. Here we have reason to apprehend the
electrified state of the earth, and the touch of the non-electric: which
caused the earthquake.

The learned Dr. _Childrey_ observes, treating on this subject, that
earthquakes happen upon rain; a sudden shower of rain in the time of a
great drought.

'Tis objected, that, if this was the case, nothing would be more frequent
than earthquakes; but these two circumstances concurring, a shower and
dry weather, must not necessarily cause it, any more than touching a
tube before it is electrified causes a snap. The earth must be in a
proper electrified state to produce it; and electricity has its fits; is
remitted, intended, ceased and recommenced. It has its bounds. All causes
must concur. And now, with us, all necessary causes did so apparently.
Tho' a shower of rain falling upon the earth when electrified, may cause
an earthquake, yet too much rain before, will prevent that state of
electricity, necessary.

The day before the catastrophe of _Port-Royal_, the weather was remarkably
serene and clear. In that most dreadful earthquake, 1692, of _Sicily_,
where 54 cities and towns, beside a great number of villages were
destroy'd; but especially the whole city of _Catania_: It was preceded by
a most agreeable, serene and warm season, which was the more observable on
account of its being unusual at that time of the year.

I have been inform'd, that in the morning of both earthquakes last past
with us, the air was serene and calm; on the morning before that 8th
of _February_, the air was observ'd to be remarkably calm; and that a
little before, a black cloud appear'd over great part of the horizon. Dr.
_Hales_, in his relation, says, the Centinels in _St. James's Park_, and
others who were abroad in the morning of the last earthquake, observ'd a
large black cloud, and some coruscations, just before the shock, and that
it was very calm weather: And that, in the history of earthquakes, they
generally begin in calm weather, with a black cloud.

This observation precludes the suspicion of earthquakes arising from
tumults and commotions in the upper, or under region of the air. The
remarkable clearness of the air before earthquakes, observ'd by all, shows
evidently how free it is from vapours and the like.

Agreeable to our _fifth_ position, Mr. _Flamsted_ writes, "A hollow noise
in the air always precedes an earthquake, so near that it rather seems to
accompany them. He refers us to _Philosophical Transactions_, N^o 151. p.
311. The noise was heard by many that liv'd in the out-streets, and alleys
of _London_, remote from the noise and tumult of the greater streets."

This he speaks of that felt in _London_ 1692; but now the whole city heard
the noise, on both these earthquakes of ours.

The gardener, who gave a relation to the Royal Society of what he observed
in the _Temple_-garden, took notice, that first he heard the most dreadful
noise imaginable, which he thought to be a great discharge of ship-guns,
on the river: and that the noise rolled from the water-side towards
_Temple-bar_, rather before the nodding of the houses.

The gentleman who observed it about _Hartingfordbury_, says, the noise
preceded the shock. And this is a common observation, which at once both
strengthens our opinion of electricity, and confutes that of subterraneous
vapours; for, in the latter case, the concussion must precede the noise.

Agreeable to out _second_ position, Mr. _Flamsted_ writes, "That
earthquakes are felt at sea, equally as on land. Our merchants say,
that, tho' the water in the bay of _Smyrna_ lies level and smooth as
a pond; yet ships riding there feel the shocks very sensibly, but in a
very different manner from the houses at land: For they heave not, but
tremble; their masts shiver, as if they would fall to pieces and their
guns start in their carriages, though the surface of the sea lies all the
time calm and unmoved." In Dr. _Hook_'s _Philosophical Collections_, N^o
6. p. 185. we are told, "That a ship felt a shock in the main ocean; that
the passengers, who had been asleep in their cabins, came upon deck in a
fright, fearing the ship had struck upon some rock; but, on heaving the
lead, found themselves out of soundings."

All this is extremely agreeable to our assumption. The water receives the
electrical touch, and vibratory intestine motion of its parts, as well as
land. And the impression may be made solely on the writer a non-electric,
by the touch of an electric fire-ball, or the like; and that seems to have
been often the care. The proper vibratory motion is impress'd on the water
without ruffling its surface; and so communicated to all the parts of the
ship, gives the sense of a shock to the bottom, the shivering to the mast,
and the rest of the symptoms: which sufficiently proclaim the cause of it
to be an electrical impression upon the water. The president mentioned
a relation of a waterman, that felt it in his boat upon the river; he
thought it like a great thump at the bottom of the boat. And so the ships
at sea fancy, they strike upon a rock.

This makes us apprehend, the reason of the fishes leaping up out of
the canal in _Southwark_, of which we had an account. So in that of
_Oxford_, 1683, one fishing in the _Charwell_ felt his boat tremble under
him, and the lesser fishes seem'd affrighted by an unusual skipping.
That electricity is the cause sought for, seems deducible from this
consideration. Several writers on earthquakes assimilate these vibrations
of the earth to those of a musical string. Experiments have shown, that
fishes in water may be killed by the particular tone of a musical string;
and 'tis known, that electricity will kill animals. They assuredly felt
the vibratory motion in the water, which they were absolutely strangers
to before. No doubt it made them sick; as those of weak nerves on land.
And this circumstance alone precludes any suspicion of subterraneous fires
under the ocean. Or, if we were to admit of it, would the boiling of the
water exhibit any appearance, like what we are speaking of, either to the
water, or to the ship?

Mr. _Flamsted_ likewise concurs in our _eighth_ position, "That many
people found themselves suddenly sick at stomach, and their heads dizzy
and light; so that those that had formerly fits of apoplexies, dreaded
their return; particularly, one gentleman, a surgeon, feeling himself so
affected, and fearing a return of his apoplexy, resolved to be let blood,
without suspecting the earthquake."

After these two shocks which we felt, many people had pains in their
joints and back, as after electrifying; many had sickness, headakes,
hysteric and nervous disorders, and colicks, for the whole day after, and
some much longer, especially people of weak nerves, weak constitutions;
some women miscarry'd upon it; to some it has prov'd fatal.

To this we must attribute, that relation we had, of the dog lying asleep
before the fire; but upon the earthquake, he suddenly rose up, run about
the room, whining, and endeavouring to get out.

Any solid matter is capable of being put into a state or electricity,
such as iron guns; and the more so, by reason of their solidity. And in
proportion to it, is the greatness of the snap, and of the shock; and
a kind of lambent flame issues from the point of contact; and likewise
somewhat of a sulphureous smell: So that if both flame and smell were
discernible in an earthquake; 'tis to be found, without going to the
bowels of the earth.

Dr. _Hales_ mentions, that solid bodies are the best conductors of aereal
lightning; whence oaks are rent, and iron melted. And in our earthquakes
in _London_, the loudest noise was heard near such large stone buildings,
as churches, with lofty steeples. From the top of these we must apprehend,
that the electrical explosion goes off into the open air; as in our
experiments, from the point of swords, and the like.

The electrical shock is proportionate to the solid electrified, agreeable
to our _seventh_ position. This fully accounts for earthquakes in general,
and for many in particular. What can be imagin'd greater than a shock of
the body of the earth? 'Tis greater, or less in proportion to the state of
electrification. And now we can account for several appearances. In the
first earthquake, the Lord Chancellor, Masters in Chancery, and several
Judges, were sitting in _Westminster-Hall_, with their backs to the wall
of the upper-end, which is of a vast thickness. They all relate the
severity of the shock, from the wall seeming to push towards them with
great violence.

And thus in the earthquake of 1692, _Deal_ castle is one of them built
by _Henry_ VIII. the walls are of immense thickness, and strength; yet
they shook so sensibly, that the people living in it, expected it was
falling on their heads. And this is the case in all earthquakes: the more
substantial the building, the more violent is the shock: exactly the mode
of electrical vibration. And this Dr. _Hales_ takes notice of and others;
that an earthquake shatters rocks of marble, more easily than the _strata_
of sand, earth, or gravel. In the earthquake here of 1692, a great cliff
fell down near _Dover_; and part of _Saltwood_-castle wall.

'Tis from hence we account for that observation, that when we electrify
any person; upon a touch, the pain and blow of the shock is felt at the
joints, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, for instance, more than in the
intermediate parts; because _there_ is the greatest quantity of solid.

At the same time, that the force of electricity in solids, is as the
quantity of matter: we see most evidently, by innumerable experiments,
that water is equally assistant in strengthening, and conveying the force
of electricity; and _that_ in proportion too to its quantity. And hence
is to be deduc'd the reason of my observation; that the most frequent and
dreadful earthquakes have fallen upon maritime places. And I find the same
is taken notice of in some degree, by _Acosta_, by _Dolittle_, who wrote
on that in 1692, and others.

In the dreadful catastrophe at _Port-Royal_ then, 'tis notorious, that its
violence was chiefly near the sea. So _Lima_ could not suffer without its
port of _Callao_. Even in those so lately felt by us, they were sensibly
more violent towards the river, than farther from it.

In that earthquake which was felt in _England_, in the year 1692, (which
was very much like these with us) there were no houses thrown down, nor
persons kill'd: but it reach'd more particularly _Sheerness_, _Sandwich_,
_Deal_, _Dover_, _Portsmouth_, and the maritime parts of _Holland_,
_Flanders_, and _Normandy_.

In this that happened on _Sunday_ the 18th of _March_ last, at _Bath_;
it was felt particularly and strongly at _Portsmouth_, seven miles
above and below it, on the sea-side; all round the isle of _Wight_,
at _Southampton_, the sea-coast of _Selsey_, south of _Chichester_,
_Arundel_, and the whole coast of _Sussex_, without going up the land; and
across the sea to the islands of _Jersey_ and _Guernsey_.

On _Monday_ night, the 2d of this instant _April_, 1750, at ten o'clock,
at _Leverpool_, a shock of an earthquake. And felt in several other places
in the neighbourhood; but particularly at _Chester_, and _Warington_.

If we look into ancient history, we find 197 years before Christ, an
earthquake shook terribly the isle of _Rhodes_, damag'd many cities: and
some quite swallow'd up.

Seventeen years before Christ, many cities in the isle of _Cyprus_
destroy'd.

Six years before Christ, the isle of _Coos_ vehemently afflicted.

During the _Peloponnesian_ war among the _Greeks_, the isle of _Delos_
shaken, and the most beautiful temple of _Apollo_ thrown down.

Soon after, the city of _LacedÃ¦mon_ totally destroy'd.

_A. D._ 79. Three cities in _Cyprus_ overthrown.

_A. D._ 82. The city of _Smyrna_ ruined.

In the time of _Valens_ the emperor, a terrible earthquake in _Crete_,
whereby 100 cities were destroy'd.

_Feb._ 13, 1247, An earthquake, chiefly felt in the _Thames_. _Matt.
Paris._

_May_, 1382, A general earthquake, which did much mischief; the _Friday_
following one less; the _Saturday_ following, one felt mostly by water.
_Henry de Knyhton._ _Holinshed._

_A. D._ 1456, In the city of _Naples_, 40,000 people lost.

_Constantinople_ has often suffer'd; particularly in 1509, 13,000 people
overwhelm'd.

1531, At _Lisbon_, 1400 houses thrown down; as many shatter'd.

_April_, 1690, The _Leeward-Islands_, _Montserat_, _Nevis_, and _Antigua_:
At _Martinico_, and the _French_ islands, at St. _Lucia_, &c. a violent
earthquake.

_Dec._ 8, 1703, An earthquake at _Hull_, a perfect calm.

1702, At _Stroution_, in _Argyleshire_, which extended all along the west
coast of _Great-Britain_; but to no breadth on land.

_Oct._ 25, 1734, At _Havant_, in _Sussex_, considerable, the air perfectly
calm.

But instances enough, to show what I aim'd at, that maritime places are
most subject; which is a strong argument in favour of electricity; when
both the solid of the earth, and the quantity of the water concur, to make
the shock; exactly as in electrical experiments; when the bottle of water
is held in the hand.

Thus when our mind is discharged of the prejudices of former notions, we
discern, that every appearance favours the principle we go upon. That,
agreeable to Mr. _Flamsted_, subterraneous explosions, could they pervade,
and traverse the earth at pleasure, must at last burst, and disperse
every thing in their way. Yet 'tis not possible for us to imagine, such
a kind of vibration should follow, either by sea or land, as that we are
treating of. But electricity compleatly answers it. This accounts for
that superficial movement of the earth, that universal instantaneous
shock, which made every house in _London_ to tremble, none to fall: That
quivering, tremulous, horizontal vibration, highly different from any
motion we must conceive, to be produc'd from subterraneous evaporations.
Hence authors tell us, _Dec._ 30, 1739, describing an earthquake in the
west-riding of _Yorkshire_: It seem'd as if the earth mov'd backward and
forward horizontally; a quivering, with reciprocal vibrations.

Mr. _Flamsted_ rightly accounts the motion of earthquakes to be
undulatory; and by being continued, causes a like motion to a great
distance. As when you strike a long stretch'd string of wire at one end,
the motion is immediately continued to the other. So far he entered into
the nature of electricity.

Tho' he be in the right, thinking the cause comes from the air, yet what
follows, contradicts his own hypothesis. For if a calm be necessary before
an earthquake; then 'tis not produc'd by any turbulence in the air. Nor
can we imagine that any aerial commotion, tho' it may shake windows,
chimneys, and the like, shall reach 500 miles distance, split the solid
earth, destroy whole cities, and cause those dire desolations we hear of.

Mr. _Flamsted_ mentions a circumstance, that the earthquake here in 1692,
was not felt in the north of _England_, nor in all _Scotland_: for rain
fell that day in both. We may very readily conceive, the earth there was
not in an electrified state; and the rain would sufficiently prevent it.
We hence understand, how the southern regions should be more subject to
them, than our northern; where the warmth, and driness of the air, so
necessary to electricity, is more frequent than with us.

From electric vibration only can we account for our _tenth_ position, of
springs, and fountains being no ways damag'd by earthquakes: The motion
goes no deeper into the earth, than the force and quantity of the shock
reaches; which generally is not far; yet it proceeds lower down when the
ready passage of a well offers, and _there_ affects the water contained in
it; puts it into an intestine vibration, as to foul it, and raise mud from
the bottom.

It may seem difficult to conceive, how a large portion of the earth's
surface should be thus capable of electrification. This difficulty
is lessened by reflecting on the nature of electricity, and of the
electrical, ethereal fluid pervading all things: how it is excited by the
little motion of a small revolving glass globe. By this we electrify the
most solid bodies, to the greatest distance, and with a velocity equal to
that of lightning.

Dr. _Hales_ observes, that the usual explosion of the cannon on great
days, in St. _James_'s-_Park_, is observ'd to electrify the glass, in the
windows of the Treasury.

We must conceive, that when the electric shock is communicated to one part
of the earth, it extends itself proportionably to the force of the shock,
and to the quantity of electrified surface; and to the quality of the
matter more or less susceptible of it, more or less apt to propagate it.

Set 1000 men in a row; let every one communicate with those next him by
an iron-wire held in their hands: on an electrical shock they all feel
it alike, at the same instant; and this gives us a very good idea of the
earthquake.

When the earth is broken up in any large degree, 'tis by the sea-side;
where sometimes on a bold shore, whole streets tumble into the sea, or
into the gaping earth, now falling toward the sea. Sometimes on a flat and
sandy shore, whole streets are rolled along the level into the sea.

I am not sensible of any real objection against our _hypothesis_, but
this, being the _eleventh_ of my positions, or circumstances. It seems
true, that earthquakes are more frequent in _Italy_, near _Vesuvius_,
and by _Ã†tna_, in _Sicily_. And the cause seems apparently owing to
these vulcano's. At first sight, every one would think so, but not from
the true reason. This has given the great prejudice to the judgments
of the curious, even at this day. But consider the matter impartially,
and it will appear, so far from being a strong argument in favour of
subterraneous eruptions, that it ought to be esteem'd a convincing proof
to the contrary, and most cogent in favour of my principle. In strictest
logic, there is no inference to be made from particulars to generals.
Quite the contrary. We have but these two or three vulcano's on one
quarter of the globe, and two of them toward the warmer climate of it;
whereas earthquakes are innumerable, especially in those of a warmer
clime. That there are no vulcano's, no discharges of fire and smoke for a
continuance, and abundance, after earthquakes; no suspicion of it either
from sight or smell, as we know by innumerable examples, as well as in
our own country, and experience: is demonstration, that this is not the
cause. If the vulcano's were the real cause of earthquakes, we ought
assuredly to expect, that in the countries thereabouts, the earthquakes
ought to be far more extensive than those in other countries, where are
no vulcano's; but this is altogether contrary to experience. For, as the
celebrated naturalist _Buffon_ observes, such are not extensive, as are
near _Ã†tna_ and _Vesuvius_. He further adds: _Histoire naturelle_, tom.
I. p. 508. speaking, among many others, of a _vulcano_ in the island of
_Ternate_, he remarks, "That this burning gulph is less agitated when
the air is calm, and the season mild, than in storms and hurricanes;"
and says, "This confirms what I have said in my foregoing discourse, and
seems evidently to prove, that the fire which makes _vulcano's_ comes not
from the bottom of mountains, but from the tops, or at least from a very
little depth; and that the hearth (or floor) of the fire is not far from
the summit of the _vulcano's_; for, if this was not the case, great winds
could not contribute to their conflagration." And this, in general, is a
corroborative proof of my whole hypothesis. For there can be no great fire
in the earth, where there is no great conveyance of air.

We have one vulcano in the cold region of _Iceland_, and there is
sometimes an earthquake there; but, in the countries of that northern
latitude, and those of lesser, 'tis obvious in all history, that
earthquakes are less frequent than in the more southern. Therefore 'tis
easy, and very natural to conclude, from all considerations weighed
together, that these vulcano's help to put the earth about them, into that
vibratory state and condition of electricity, which is the requisite in my
_hypothesis_, and by that means only, promote a frequency of earthquakes
there.

I have only one circumstance to add, which may seem not inconsiderable;
probably perceived by many, tho' not taken notice of. For a whole week
before the first earthquake, the partition wainscot of my house (between
the forward and backward rooms) made an odd kind of tremulous, crackling
noise continually, as if the wainscot would split; or as if some damage
was apprehended to the house. This was observ'd by the family, with a good
deal of concern. _That_ in the chamber crackled more than that below.
We never perceiv'd it before, nor since; and apparently, it shows the
vibratory state of the surface of the earth, at that time.

But whether our conjectures upon this important subject be well founded
or no, it certainly becomes a christian philosopher, whilst he is
investigating material causes, to look up, and regard the moral use of
them. For in reality, every thing, the whole world, was ultimately for
that purpose made. When we see such a kind of spirituality impress'd on
mere matter, as this amazing property of electricity, it should kindle in
us a high ambition of asserting, and exerting the infinitely superior
value, and powers, and excellency of the spiritual part of us, destin'd
to an immortal duration. And of all the great and public calamities,
which affect us mortals, earthquakes claim the first title to the name
of warnings and judgments. None so proper to threaten, or to execute
vengeance upon a guilty people. Nor has any other, those annexed terrors,
so much of the unusual, the unavoidable, the sudden and the horrible
apprehension of being crush'd to death, or buried alive. And when in our
own sight, these rare and extraordinary _phÃ¦nomena_ appear, it cannot but
be a lesson to us, to do our duty toward that great Being, who, by a drop
of water, can produce effects so prodigious.

That earthquakes proclaim themselves to mankind in this light, is further
deducible from this observation, the _ninth_ in our recapitulation of
circumstances; that they are peculiarly directed to great cities, and
maritime towns, those nurseries of wealth, luxury, and of all the evils
naturally flowing therefrom. It would be childish to rehearse from old
history, or modern, a proof of it. We have no other notices of them. Look
upon these two shocks we have here felt. We own that _Hampsted-heath_, and
_Finchley-forest_, and _Kennington-common_ were affected with it; yet it
is notorious, that _London_ was the center, the place to which the finger
of God was pointed.

And this leads us in the _third_ place, to consider the moral use and
purpose of these _magnalia naturÃ¦_, and prodigies of the agency of
material causes. For nothing sure, but an electrical shock, and that from
a divine hand, could have been so well adjusted, as twice, nay four times,
so sensibly to shake every house in _London_, and not throw one down. This
duty we will endeavour to execute, from the words of that great man, king
_David_.

[Illustration]




                             PSALM xviii. 7.

  _Then the earth shook, and trembled; the foundations also of the
     hills moved, and were shaken; because he was wroth._


This Psalm is a triumphal song, which _David_ deliver'd publickly before
God, in thankful remembrance of the great mercies he had receiv'd;
being firmly established on his throne: and all his enemies, foreign or
domestick, subdued.

He does not attribute this happy situation of his affairs to his own
prudence and courage; but, like a consummate politician, absolutely to
the mediation of the divine providence. He draws up a most grand and
magnificent description of the advent of the deity, such as words never
before expressed. All the heathen pictures of the appearance of their
gods, are cold and lame, compar'd to this; which is deservedly so much
admir'd by all criticks that have any taste for religion, as well as
language.

This verse, in our text, is the first movement in the scene, which was to
represent the appearance of _Jehovah_, without whose interposition _David_
hoped for nothing fortunate. After describing all the pomp of light,
and darkness, celestial; hailstones, thunder, lightning, and the like
instances of majesty and terror, in the skies; he still keeps his eye on
the ground, and concludes with the earthquake, where he began.

_Then the channels of waters were seen; and the foundations of the earth
were discovered; at thy rebuke, O Lord; at the blast of the breath of thy
nostrils._

Our holy psalmist, at other times, has exhibited the same images, in
different coloring; as a great master varies his works, to strike out all
the beauties.

Psal. lxviii. 7. _O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people; when
thou didst march thro' the wilderness; the earth shook, the heavens also
dropped, at the presence of God. Even Sinai itself was moved, at the
presence of God; the God of Israel._

By this he means, the giving the law. _Exod._ xix. 8. _And mount Sinai
was altogether on a smoke; because the Lord descended on it in fire: and
the smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked
greatly._

Again, Psal. cxiv. when he is describing the passage over the _Red-sea_,
and that over _Jordan_; he brings in the machinery of earthquakes, to
testify the divine presence.

_When Israel went out of Egypt, and the house of Jacob from among a
strange people; the sea saw it and fled. Jordan was driven back._

_The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep._

Then he asks the question, _What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou
fleddest? and thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?_

_Ye mountains that ye skipped like rams, and ye little hills like young
sheep?_

He answers: _Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord: at the
presence of the God of Jacob._

He fails not to attribute these marvellous appearances, to their true
cause. Tho' he knew full well, that the God of nature administred the
ordinary course of the earth by second causes; yet he could not be so
blind but to perceive, when the waves of the ocean retreated; when the
waters of _Jordan_ divided; when mount _Sinai_ was all in fire, smoke,
lightning and thunder, with the trumpet of God sounding, and the whole
mountain shaking: he could not but perceive the presence of the author of
nature, in these extraordinary appearances.

But every where in sacred scripture earthquakes are particularly singled
out, above all other natural _phÃ¦nomena_, as having more of the majesty
and terrific pomp, to denote an immediate operation of God's hand; to
excite our fear, and shew his anger, as in our text, _because he was
wroth_. In imitation of the sacred writers, the heathen poets, both
_greek_ and _latin_, express the anger of their _Jupiter_ by an earthquake:

    _Terrificam capitis concussit terque quaterque
     CÃ¦sariem; cum qua terram, mare, sidera, movit._

                                                                 Ovid.

The moving meteors in the free air, lightning, coruscations,
fire-balls, tempests, thunders, or the dreaded comets, tho' frightful
enough; yet people that do not think to any purpose, hope, as they are at
a distance, to escape their effects. But when the terror comes home to
us, to our feet; when the earth moves on which we stand; what heart is
not moved? When our houses _shake_ over our ears, the greatest courage is
_shaken_.

It is true, an earthquake causes an universal dread among all sorts of
people; even the philosopher immersed in speculation of second causes,
quakes; as well as the pious, whose fear proceeds from solid piety: a due
sense of the _anger_ of the almighty Being.

We saw how the late earthquakes affrighted every one; but, as to the
generality, it was but for a moment. When they found themselves safe, and
alive; thoughtless they ran to their business, or their diversion: and
this not only the first, but the second time. And I am apprehensive, were
another, and another to come, they would only be less regarded than the
preceding. As the _Israelites_, to whom miracles became familiar; as the
_Jews_, in our Saviour's time, demanding of him to show them a sign from
heaven, in the midst of the constant scene of miracles innumerable.

But 'tis my present business to call you to a due and serious reflexion,
on these extraordinary events; by considering,

I. What the written word of God, the holy scriptures, informs us,
concerning the ultimate purpose of earthquakes.

II. What we can learn from profane history.

III. To conclude with our text, that they are strictly and properly divine
judgments; _because he was wroth_.

Ever since the earth began, earthquakes have been look'd on as
extraordinary appearances, among the prodigies of nature, and executioners
of divine justice. In the case of _Korah_, _the earth opened her mouth and
swallowed them up; and their houses, and all the men that pertained unto
them; and all their goods_.

In the miraculous victory obtain'd by _Jonathan_, and his armor-bearer,
over the army of the _Philistines_, I. _Sam._ xiv. There was a panic
terror infus'd into the _Philistines_, and an _earthquake_: it is call'd
_a very great trembling of God_. What the heathen attributed to _Pan_, an
imaginary deity of their own making: the _Hebrews_ rightly refer'd to the
true cause, the first, and supreme.

In the new testament, at our Saviour's death, there was a great
earthquake, which was altogether miraculous; as much as the eclipse of the
sun then. The elements might well sympathize with the God of nature. _The
sun was darkened, the vail of the temple was rent in twain; the earth did
quake, the rocks rent._

Again, at his resurrection, _Matt._ xxviii. 2. _There was a great
earthquake. The angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and rolled back
the stone from the door, and sat upon it._

_And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men._

_Matt._ xxvii. 54. _When the centurion, and they that were with him,
watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, they feared greatly._ See the
consequence of it in one place; and thus in another:

_Acts_ iv. 31. _The Apostles_, in the infant church, _when praying, the
place was shaken, where they were assembled together: and they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost_. The heathen centurion _feared_ upon the
earthquake: The christians praying, were _filled with the Holy Ghost_.

_Acts_ xvi. 26. When _Paul_ and _Silas_ were in prison. _At mid-night when
they pray'd, and sang hymns to God, suddenly there was a great earthquake;
so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the
doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed._

Observe the consequence it had upon the gaoler; _He called for a light,
and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?_

The gaol trembled; and the gaoler trembled, as is observed by a writer on
this head, an earthquake could _soften_ his _hard_ heart, and _open_ what
he had _lock'd_. It awaken'd him out of his spiritual slumber, as well as
his natural sleep, and made his conscience, as well as the foundations of
the prison, to quake. A bad conscience is _as a troubled sea, that cannot
rest, but casteth up mire, and clay_. The gaoler perceiv'd the celestial
warning, and made a proper use of it.

There are many circumstances in the nature of earthquakes, which render
them peculiarly proper to be the instruments in God's hand, to give
warning to a people, to amend their ways.

The _suddenness_ is one. We saw, not long ago, what an effect was produced
by a solar eclipse, tho' it was expected long before. We had the
prediction, and calculations about it in all our almanacs; yet there was
an universal seriousness that followed it. All that morning, we could walk
the street, without hearing an oath, and the churches were full, in time
of prayer. But the _suddenness_ of an earthquake that comes at an instant,
unthought of, without warning, that seems to bring unavoidable death along
with it; is able to touch an adamantin heart. To see death stalking o'er a
great city, ready to sweep us all away, in an instantaneous ruin, without
a single moment to recollect our thoughts; this is fear without remedy;
this is far beyond battle and pestilence. The lightning and thunderbolt,
_the arrow that flieth by day_, may suddenly take off an object or two,
and leave no space for repentance: but what horror can equal that, when
above a million of people are liable to be buried, in one common grave!

Another consideration that inhances the dread of earthquakes, is the
_unavoidableness_ of the calamity. Famine, and war, and rebellion, and
pestilence we may run from, the disease among the cattle, and locusts, and
the like stripes of angry heaven, we may have some chance to escape: but
no means, no precaution, no remedy, no prudence can screen us, from so
universal a desolation as this: 'tis as the presence of God. Whither then
can we go to hide ourselves? Must we call upon the rocks and mountains,
to cover, and shelter us from the divine wrath! _And they shall go into
the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the_
Lord, _and for the glory of his majesty; when he ariseth to shake terribly
the earth_. Alas, those are the very instruments he employs for our
destruction; to be our tombstones!

This _unusual_ kind of death too, strikes us with horror; to be buried
alive. The earth, the common mother of us all, and the common grave; to
eat up her offspring alive; crouds all the images of amazement together,
that can enter into the heart of man.

The greater the terror accompanying earthquakes, the greater a blessing
is our deliverance from the danger of it! What can equal God's power and
judgment but his mercy? Consider the wonderful consequence; that the whole
city of _London_ should so sensibly be shaken, and yet no one inhabited
house to fall; nor one person kill'd. Amazing instance of power, and
goodness, in our preservation! And this not only once, but the second time
also; tho' evidently stronger was the concussion. So strong that almost
every person was throughly persuaded, that some part, at least, of their
houses, was falling down. Can we help admiring, that judgment should be
so temper'd with mercy! Do we look only at the second causes with our
unbelievers; and sport away the divine presence, as if it was an ordinary
occurrence of every day? They want to see a miracle. Nought can affect
them, but a direct, supernatural agency.

I answer, behold a visible, and notorious miracle; plainly obvious, and
before all their senses. For can there be a greater miracle, can any thing
be more directly the finger of God than this, which we ourselves saw with
our eyes; that befell the whole city of _London_.

We know the nature of the building of _London_ houses; which sometimes
fall of themselves, without shaking. Wonderful then is it to be thought,
and a miracle indeed, that every house in this vast city, should twice be
agitated, and rocked to and fro; and not one fall, nor one person receive
any damage.

In vain will the philosophers seek for a solution of this problem, in
natural causes only. By their chymical experiments, they make some little
mimic imitations of tremors and fumes, and explosions. So by gun-powder,
we ape the regal voice of thunder. But where is the discretionary act of
mercy, and benignity, that separates between the vengeful and kind? These
second causes act according to their material nature, like the roaring
waves of the ocean, that flow in, and overwhelm every thing, where a
breach is made. They can observe no distinction between the lands of a
righteous man, and of a sinner: they cannot stop at the breach, and gather
themselves on an heap, and not enter in at all, as the waters of _Jordan_
did.

But in the case before us, the hand of the Lord, that stayed the flowing
of the waters, that quelled the raging of the sea, and its proud waves;
sets bounds to the trembling of the earth. Hither shall its vibrations go,
and no further. When alas, if it went but one inch further (in comparison)
a total ruin must unavoidably follow.

Consider this particular, when apply'd to all the buildings in this
immense city: and wonder and adore, that almighty providence, which
overlook'd us, and prescrib'd the limits; so narrow, so precise; which
sav'd us from universal havoc!

II. Did we escape; how much happier are we, than the millions that have
perished by the like calamity? _Josephus_ the famous _Jewish_ historian
records, that about 29 years before our Saviour's birth, there happened
such an earthquake in the country of _Judea_, that 30,000 men perished.

In the fifth year of the reign of _Tiberius_, so dreadful an earthquake
happened in _Asia minor_, that no less than 13 cities were destroy'd in
one night; many of them great, and Royal: _Sardis_ in particular, said to
be second to _Babylon_.

In _A. D._ 66. Another earthquake happen'd there, which destroy'd
_Laodicea_, _Hierapolis_, and _Colossus_.

_A. D._ 79. Three cities in _Cyprus_ were overthrown.

_A. D._ 114. The city of _Antioch_ suffered extremely; whilst the emperor
_Trajan_ was in it. And in the 7th year of that emperor, nine several
cities were destroy'd in _Asia_, _Greece_, and _Calabria_.

To come nearer home, and our own times: In 1169, _Catania_ in _Sicily_ was
destroyed, and 15,000 people killed.

1692, The whole city destroy'd and 18000 Inhabitants.

1456, At _Naples_ 40,000 perished by an earthquake.

1531, In the city of _Lisbon_, 1400 houses were overthrown there, besides
many damaged.

We know the miserable and deplorable catastrophe of _Port-Royal_,
in _Jamaica_; which fell out in our own days. My blood shudders at
the relation of it. And not many months ago, the populous _Lima_ in
_America_, was wholly swallowed up.

Have we not reason then to fear, for ourselves? 'Tis true, we have
hitherto escaped. But can we tell how soon God shall let loose the
avenging power of another; which may come, for ought we know, while we are
speaking of it. And if it must come, happy may it be for us, that it finds
us in this place, and so doing.

III. And this brings us, to consider the uses of these admonitions; and to
show, that they are the effects of the divine anger. _For the earth shook
and trembled_, says the holy psalmist, _the foundation of the hills moved
and were shaken; because he was wroth_.

And here we cannot possibly have a stronger and more convincing evidence,
of these convulsions of nature, being the immediate finger of God, than
this single consideration. Let us but reflect on what has been said, in
short; that these visitations only happen to great and populous cities, to
great and eminent ports, and maritime _emporiums_ flourishing in trade,
riches, and luxury.

We hear not of barren desarts, uninhabited wildernesses, wide heaths, and
downs, rocky cliffs, and beaches of the sea, to be the usual subject of
earthquakes: but of towns and cities. Not so much of little villages, but
of those immense collections of people. God does not give his warnings
to birds, and beasts of the forest; to flocks of sheep; that punctually
execute the respective offices he has enjoined them: but to us, the lords
of the creation; to whom he has given reason, sense, and faculties, to
reflect, and judge of things, of our own actions, as well as his; of _his_
doings, toward the children of men.

We observed before, a plain and notorious proof of God's hand in these
judgments; that he cou'd move a whole city without throwing down a house.
And this is most assuredly a second proof; that he visits _only_ great
cities, with these judgments. And we must conclude this to be as strong an
argument of a divine interposition in these affairs, as any mathematical
demonstration.

Some free-thinkers, or free-livers, when they find, they cannot set aside
this reasoning, shelter themselves, with the history of God's converse
with _Abraham_; about the cities of _Sodom_ and _Gomorrha_; assuring
themselves, there is no danger. For tho' they can't pretend to be the
meritorious people; yet they think God's mercy will be as signal to us, as
heretofore: and that we have among us, at least ten righteous persons, to
save the rest.

But vain are such hopes: God will say to them, as heretofore to the
_Jews_: _If I bring my great judgments upon the earth, as I live saith the
Lord, tho'_ Noah, Daniel, _and_ Job _were there; they should save neither
sons, nor daughters, but their own souls only_.

God can, if he pleases, by very extraordinary means, preserve such as
he thinks fit. But in general judgments, the righteous must undergo one
common fate, with the wicked. God's mercy will be shown to them after this
life, to make the superabundant amends.

But this is a solid lesson to us, of the necessity of a future life. We
may as well banish God out of the earth, as to deny his attributes of
power, and goodness, and justice, and the like. And these will insure us
of a future state; when an exact return will be made, for our behaviour in
this; otherwise we might justly expostulate, as _Abraham_ did, _Will not
the judge of all the earth do right?_

Good men, who have endeavour'd to do their duty, may say, _God is our
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we
fear, tho' the earth be remov'd; tho' the mountains be carried into the
midst of the sea; tho' the waters thereof roar, and be troubled; tho' the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof._

_Come behold the works of the Lord; what desolations he hath made on the
earth._

In the mean time, let us not think on running _away_ from the danger, so
much as on mending our _ways_; perfecting the christian life; reforming
the abominable crimes, so justly chargeable on great and maritime cities;
overflowing with riches, pride, and luxury, with vanity, pleasure, and
profaneness; with gaming, immorality, infidelity; and especially with the
notorious crime of sabbath-breaking, which is the foundation of all, and
comprehends all others; for it prevents people from amending of any. If
they fail of their duty towards God, in making their regular approaches
to his temple; no wonder they are guilty of all crimes; regard neither
God nor man. If they fail of coming, where they may hope for the kindly
influences of God's holy Spirit; we need not wonder at their egregious
wickedness: they become absolutely irreclaimable.

But of you, my beloved brethren, here assembled, I hope better things.
You shun the degenerate corruptions of this evil age; you are not of the
number of those that frequent our public meetings of folly, from the
morning rendezvouzes to the mid-night assemblies; and _that_ protracted to
the morning light again. As if we ought to banish all serious thoughts of
our immortal interests; and _that_ in the sacred season of lent; destin'd
by the church, for this very serious purpose.

Let us think, how this warning happen'd to us, in the time of lent; when
they were revelling in their places of entertainment, both morning and
evening, as if no such thing had been; and this on the very days; as
if they confronted, and dar'd almighty vengeance. Much of a parallel
case with that of the famous city of _Herculaneum_, which is now the
entertainment of the curious. First it was miserably shatter'd by an
earthquake; whilst the people were at their diversions in the theatre;
where all assembled perished. This was in the first year of _Titus_
the emperor: but such a partial judgment not mending their manners; 9
years after, the whole city was destroy'd by a lake of liquid fire and
brimstone, from mount _Vesuvius_, just in the manner we now find it; 50
foot deep in cinders, and ashes.

_When thy judgments, O God, are abroad, the inhabitants of the earth will
learn righteousness._

_The Lord is the true God; he is the living God; the everlasting King: At
his wrath, the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to
abide his indignation_; says the prophet _Jeremiah_, x. 10.

God give us grace, that instead of these short-liv'd, and unsatisfying
pleasures; instead of palaces and houses here, ornamented in a sumptuous
and elegant _taste_; which may perhaps be swept away, with their owners,
in a moment; we may aspire towards that heavenly city, which is above;
whose foundations are not laid with hands, eternal in the heavens, _&c._

PREFACE.


_This discourse is but a necessary consequence of the preceding. The
whole no other than an essay, toward investigating the true nature of the
wonderful appearance of an earthquake. And something is done toward it,
if only by eradicating an old error. In attaining the proposed end, I
have endeavour'd to lay all the necessary circumstances together, which
to our great amazement we have seen, and felt. That they may not be as
soon forgotten, as they generally were, by the giddy multitude; equally
thoughtless of what they knew to be past, as childishly fearful of an
imaginary one, subsequent: for which there could not be the least ground
of apprehension. By sober persons it was, with great reason, thought a
judicial infatuation, and as much to be wonder'd at, as an earthquake
itself; a real panic. When a third part of this immense city ran out into
the fields for half a cold night; alarm'd with the silly prediction of a
distemper'd fellow!_

_Nothing could tempt one to commemorate the follies of our cotemporaries,
but the hope, it may be useful hereafter: and to show the true cause
of this senseless terror; the want of a true sense of religion; and an
universal degeneracy, and corruption of manners: begun by the great ones,
and now propagated thro' all degrees to the lowest: begun in this great
city; and now advancing apace to every great town in the kingdom._

_'Tis from the great ones alone, that we can hope for a reformation:
and_ that _by a strict observance of the sabbatical duty. Example, we
know, governs the actions of mankind_. That _must restore the practice,
and the influence of religion: which alone can prevent the dangers that
infest every corner of our streets; every road in the kingdom. We mistake
the point, and betray our ignorance in human nature, when we think,
acts of parliament, laws, and executions will do it. They are very weak
in comparison of the impressions of religion, and conscience: as all
philosophy both natural and religious, has hitherto thought, and known._




                                    TO

                       _Martin Folkes_, Esq; LL. D.

                     President of the Royal Society.


Since I had the honour to lay before the Society, in the spring, my
thoughts upon earthquakes: we have had many further opportunities of
reflecting upon that most awful, and hitherto unusual appearance. An
earthquake was felt at _Eastwell_ in _Kent_, on _monday march_ 12, and on
_sunday, march_ 18, at _Portsmouth_, the _Isle of Wight_, _Southampton_,
and along the coast of _Sussex_, the isles of _Guernsey_, _Jersey_.
_April_ 2, a smart earthquake at _Manchester_, _Liverpool_, _Taunton_,
_Bath_, _Flint_, _Lancaster_, _Wrexham_, reaching 40 miles north and
south: 70 miles east and west. Since then at _Rome_, _Naples_, _Leghorn_;
in the south of _France_, and at _Pau_ under the _Pyrenean_ mountains:
_Oporto_, at _S. Macaire_ in _Guienne_, _Messina_ in _Sicily_, _Munich_ in
_Bavaria_, &c. &c. so that the year 1750, may rather be called the year
of earthquakes, than of jubilee. For since _February_ last, when they
began with us at _London_; as far as I can learn, they have appear'd in
many parts of _Europe_, _Asia_, _Africa_, and _America_. And have likewise
revisited many counties in our own island, and at length, on the 30th of
last _september_ gave much the most extensive shock, we have seen here in
our days.

It may be well expected, that these frequent visits, in themselves so very
extraordinary, to us so rare, and _that_ in one year, should keep up our
attention: and as to my own part, induce one to reflect, on what I before
offer'd concerning them; and be a sufficient apology for the present paper.

We have been acquainted, by those who remember it, that in the earthquake
of nov. 1703, which happen'd in _Lincolnshire_, the weather was calm,
close, gloomy, warm, and dry; in a degree highly unusual, at that season.
And thus it has been with us, all the year. And from the numerous accounts
we have receiv'd at the Royal Society, in the beginning, and ending of the
year; where any mention is made of the weather; they all agree in the like
particular. Which is consentaneous to what I remark'd, as the constant
forerunner of earthquakes; and what prepares the earth's surface, for the
electrical stroke: which I asserted to be the cause of them.

In _may_ last, we had a paper read at the Royal Society, concerning
the second earthquake felt by us at _London_, on the 8th of _march_. A
shepherd belonging to Mr. Secretary _Fox_ at _Kensington_ (the sky being
perfectly serene, and clear) was much surprised with a very extraordinary
noise in the air, rolling over his head, as of cannon close by. He
likewise thought, that it came from the north-west, and went to the
south-east: a motion quite contrary, to what must have been the case, if
it were really of cannon. This noise pass'd rushing by him; and instantly
he saw the ground (a dry, and solid spot) wave under him, like the face
of the river. The tall trees of the avenue, where he was, nodded their
tops very sensibly, and quiver'd like a shaken spear. The flock of sheep
immediately took fright, and ran all away together, as if dogs had pursued
them. A great rookery in the place, were equally alarm'd, and after an
universal clangor, flew away; no less than if chaced by hawks.

I was likewise inform'd, that in the same earthquake, a great parcel of
hens, and chickens, kept at that time in _Gray's-inn-lane_, upon the
shock, ran to the roost, affrighted. And the like was observ'd of pigeons.
And in our last account of the earthquake from _Northampton_, 'tis
remarked, that the birds in cages put their heads under their wings, as
to hide themselves.

_June_ 21, at the Royal Society, Mr. _Jackson_ potter at _Lambeth_, gave
an account of some boats, cobles and lighters in the river, at that time;
the people in them seem'd to feel, as if a porpoise, or some great fish
had heav'd and thump'd at the bottom of the vessels. This is sometimes the
case of ships at sea, when all is perfectly calm: which seems evidently
owing to an electrical impression on the water.

In the evening-post of _june_ 23, we had a paragraph from _Venice_, that
a terrible earthquake had been felt lately in the little rocky isle of
_Cerigo_, in the _Mediterranean_, south of _Morea_. It threw down a great
number of houses; and above 2000 of the inhabitants were buried in the
ruins.

Another earthquake about that time, happen'd in _Switzerland_; which split
a vast, rocky mountain; and an old castle wall of an immense thickness.

All these circumstances, and many more confirmed me in my former opinion.
But since then, these wonderful movements have stalk'd round the globe:
and again been lately felt in our own island; happily for us, to the
terror only, of many thousand people: beside those concussions of this
sort that appear'd in the western parts, in the more early time of the
year.

I receiv'd a letter from my friend _Maurice Johnson_, Esq; the founder,
and secretary of the Literary Society of _Spalding_; which has now
subsisted these 40 years. He acquaints me, that on _thursday_, 23d of
_August_ last, an earthquake was very sensibly felt there, about seven
o'clock in the morning; throughout the whole town and neighbourhood;
and many miles round: but that it chiefly spread itself northward, and
southward. He says, that for a fortnight before, the weather had been
serene, mild, and calm. And one evening, there was a deep red _aurora
australis_, covering the cope of heaven, very terrible to behold.
This same shock was felt at _Grantham_, _Stamford_, and _Milton_ by
_Peterborough_; and generally at all the intermediate places: and from
_Spalding_ it fled northward, along the sea shore, to _Boston_: thence up
_Boston_ river, to _Lincoln_.

Since then, I had a letter from Mr. Alderman _Taylor_ of _Stamford_,
giving an account of another earthquake, that happen'd there, _september_
30, at 36 minutes after twelve o'clock at noon. He describes it thus.
They were suddenly surprised with an uncommon noise in the air, like the
rolling of large carriages in the streets, for about 20 seconds. At the
same instant they felt a great shake, or snap, as he calls it; insomuch
that it sensibly shook a punch-bowl, which was in his parlour, and made
it ring. He says, it was perceiv'd of most of the people of _Stamford_,
who generally ran out of their houses. At _Oakham_ the chief town of
_Rutland_, the congregation ran out of the church whilst the preacher was
in the pulpit. All the towns round _Stamford_, were sensible of it: and at
_Peterborough_, down to _Wisbech_.

Thus far the Alderman. But we have had many advices from all hands, at
the first, and second meetings of the Royal Society, for the winter
season; with further particulars relating to this great concussion. That
it was felt at the same time, at _Rugby_ in _Warwickshire_, and reach'd
to _Warwick_, at _Lutterworth_, in _Leicestershire_: at _Leicester_, and
round about. It extended itself to _Coventry_, _Derby_, _Nottingham_,
_Newark_; then came eastward to _Harborough_, _Towcester_, _Northampton_,
_Rowel_, _Kettering_, _Wellingborough_, _Oundle_, in _Northamptonshire_;
_Uppingham_, _Oakham_ in _Rutland_; _Stamford_, _Bourn_, _Grantham_,
_Spalding_, _Boston_, and to _Lincoln_ in _Lincolnshire_; _Holbech_, and
all _Holland_ in that county. _Peterborough_, _Wisbech_, in the isle of
_Ely_; together with all the intermediate, and adjacent places. Then it
passed over the whole breadth of _Ely_ fen: was felt at _Mildenhall_, and
reach'd to _Calford_ by _Bury_ in _Suffolk_, and the country thereabouts;
of which we had notice from lady _Cornwallis_. An extent from _Warwick_
to _Bury_ of about 100 miles in length; and generally speaking, 40 miles
in breadth. And this vast space was pervaded by this amazing motion, as
far as we can get any satisfaction, in the same instant of time. They
describe it, that the houses totter'd, and seem'd to heave up, and down:
tho' it lasted but a few seconds. It was attended with a rushing noise,
as if the houses were falling, and people were universally so affrighted,
as to run out; imagining that their own, or their neighbours houses
were tumbling on their heads. In the villages around, the people being
generally at divine service, were much alarm'd: both with the noise,
which exceeded all the thunder they had ever heard, beyond compare: and
with the great shock accompanying; which was like somewhat, as they
imagin'd, that rush'd against the church-walls, and roof. Some thinking
the pillars crack'd, many that the beams of the roof were disjointed;
and all, that the whole was falling. And happy were they that could get
out first. Many people fancied, that nests of drawers, and cabinets, or
the like heavy things, were fallen down above stairs: or that chimnies
had broke thro' the roof of the house: or that some persons fell down
stairs: and the like. Some perceived the crackling of inward wainscots or
partitions: as Dr. _Mortimer_ and I, observ'd in our first and second
shocks at _London_. A few slates, tiles, and parts of chimneys fell from
some houses: pewter, china, glasses and brass from shelves. A clock bell,
chamber bell sometime struck: windows universally rattled, and the like
circumstances of tremor.

In regard to circumstances, they were pretty similar throughout. Many
people sitting in their chairs relate, that they and their chairs were
several times sensibly lifted up and set down again. A stack of chimneys
were thrown down in _College-lane_; a place retaining the memory of a
sort of university once beginning at _Northampton_. The windows of houses
rattled throughout the whole town: but no mischief done: in general it was
frightful, and innocuous.

They fancied there, the motion of it, as they expressed it, to be
eastward. In streets that run north and south, the houses on the east
side of the way, were most affected. And Dr. _Stonehouse_'s dwelling,
the strongest in the town, was most sensibly shaken. So it was likewise
observ'd, that churches were most subject to its violence. They thought
too, that the motion seem'd rather horizontal, or lateral, than upward.
Some counted the pulses distinctly, to the number of four: that the
second, and third pulses were stronger, than the first, and fourth.

From all these various accounts, there was no sulphureous smell, or
eruption; no fissures in the ground perceived. Yet several people were
sick upon it: infinite numbers terribly affrighted, and as soon forgot
the impression of it; or talk'd of it in a merry strain; as commonly with
us at _London_. So little are the vulgar assessed, without something very
sensible; and so soon is the sense of it worn out!

It was more evidently perceiv'd, by people standing; most, by those
that were sitting: least, by such as were walking: and in upper stories
of houses, more than in lower; or in cellars. Some coming down stairs,
were in danger of being thrown forwards. Several sitting in a chair, and
hearing the hollow, thundering noise, and thinking it was a coach passing
by; when they attempted to get up, to see what it was, they were thrown
back again in their chair. Some heard the wainscot crackle, Some sitting
in their chairs leaning forwards, were thrown down on their hands, and
knees. Some people heard the noise without feeling the shock: others felt
the shock without hearing the noise. Some in a standing posture, were
forc'd to lay hold on a table, to keep themselves from falling.

It was particularly remarked (as before observ'd) that birds in cages
were sensibly affrighted; thrusting their heads under their wings. Mrs.
_Allicock_ of _Loddington_, _Northamptonshire_, a lady in child-bed, was
so affected, that it caused her death. Mrs. _Hardy_, another lady in the
same circumstance, and in the same county, likewise expired upon it, Some
people felt a sudden shortness of breath, that they were forc'd to go out
into the open air, it so affected the pulmonary nerves. Many were taken
with head-achs, and other sicknesses.

These are, in general, the circumstances and observations made, at
the time of these earthquakes; when we recollect ourselves, after the
suddeness, and fright. Give me leave to make the following remarks
therefrom.

1st. As far as we can possibly learn, where no one can be prepar'd,
at different places, by time keepers; this mighty concussion was felt
precisely at the same instant of time; being about half an hour after
twelve at noon. This, I presume, cannot be accounted for, by any natural
power, but by that of an electrical vibration; which, we know, acts
instantaneously.

2dly, Let us reflect on the vast extent of this trembling, 100 miles in
length, 40 in breadth, which amounts to 4000 square miles in surface. That
this should be put into such an agitation, in one moment of time, is such
a prodigy; as we should never believe, or conceive, did we not know it
to be fact, from our own senses. But if we look for a solution of it, we
cannot think, any natural power is equal to it, but that of electricity;
which acknowledges no sensible transition of time; no bounds.

3ly, We observe, the vulgar solution of subterraneous eruptions receives
no countenance, from all that was seen, or felt, during these earthquakes.
It would be very hard to imagine, how any such thing could so suddenly,
and instantaneously operate, thro' this vast space: and _that_ in so
similar, and tender a manner over the whole, thro' so great a variety, as
well as extent of country; as to do no mischief. A philosophical inquirer
in _Northamptonshire_ had his eye particularly on this point, takes
notice, there were not any fissures in the ground; any sulphureous smells,
or eruptions any where perceiv'd; so as to favour internal convulsions of
the earth. The reverend Mr. _Nixon_ of _Higham_, and Mr. _Smith_, in his
letter from _Peterborough_ take notice, that they could not learn, there
were any sort of eruptions out of the earth, any where: no smoke, vapor,
or smell: tho' they made sufficient inquiry about that circumstance,
according to particular direction. Yet we learn from a letter at
_Uppingham_ in _Rutland_, that a plaister floor became crack'd thereby.
These kind of floors are frequent in this country; what we call _stucco_
in _London_: and it gives us a good notion of the undulatory vibration,
produc'd by an earthquake; which some have compar'd to that of a musical
string: others to that of a dog, or a horse shaking themselves, when they
come out of the water. This last comparison would have pleased some of the
ancients, who would needs fancy, that the globe of the earth was a great
animal. _Plato_, _Plutarch_, and others, had such kind of sentiments.
Whence one may imagine, that they would conceive an earthquake to be, as
when a horse shakes a part of his skin, upon a fly touching him. Some of
our correspondents express the motion of an earthquake to be like a boat
lifted up by one wave, let down by another.

4ly, The former earthquake that happen'd at _Grantham_, _Spalding_,
_Stamford_, (which towns lie in a triangle) took up a space which may, in
gross, be accounted a circle of 30 miles diameter: the center of which is
that great morass, called _Deeping-fen_. This comprehends 15 miles of that
30, in diameter: and where probably, the electrical impression was first
made. Much the major part of _Deeping-fen_ is under water in the winter
time; underneath 'tis a perfect bog. Now it is very obvious, how little
favorable such ground is, for subterraneous fires.

In the second earthquake, not only this country was affected again,
but likewise a much larger space of the same sort of fenny ground,
rather worse than the former: all _Donnington-fen_, _Deeping-fen_,
_Croyland-fen_, _Thorney-fen_, _Whitlesea-fen_, _Bedford_ level, and the
whole extent of _Ely-fen_, under various denominations. This country,
under the turf, abounds with subterraneous timber of all sorts; fir, oak,
and brush-wood: and stags horns. Now and then they find a quantity of
hazel nuts, crouded together on an heap. I have some of them. This is a
matter common to all boggy ground over the whole globe, Such things are
the ruins of the _antediluvian_ world, washed down from the high country
where they grew, were here lodg'd upon the subsiding of the waters, and
by time are o'ergrown with the present turf. They that seek for any other
solution of this affair, than the universal _Noachian_ deluge, want to
account for a general effect, by a partial cause: and shut their eyes,
both to the plain history of this matter; and to the infinite, notorious
demonstrations of it, from fossil appearances.

5ly, All this country, tho' underneath 'tis a watry bog, yet thro' this
whole summer, and autumnal season (as they can have no natural springs
in such a level) the drought has been so great on the superficies, that
the inhabitants were oblig'd every day, to drive their cattle several
miles, for watering. The drought was greater, than has been known in the
memory of any one living. This shows how fit the dry surface was, for an
electrical vibration. And we learn from hence, this important particular,
that it reaches but very little below the earth's surface.

Mr. _Johnson_, in another letter which he wrote to me concerning the
second earthquake observ'd at _Spalding_; says upon this occasion, he was
obliged to scour his canal, and deepen it: that they came to a white,
quicksand; which afforded to all the neighbourhood, excellent water in
plenty.

In the gravelly soil of _London_; and where the two shocks were felt by
us, in the beginning of the year; we know, there is not a house in the
whole extent of this vast city, and all around it, but a spring of water
is ready, upon digging a well, Whence we have much reason to believe, that
the interior of the earth, is like a sponge soak'd in water. So that the
only dry part is the superficies, which is the object, and the subject
of that electric vibration; wherein, according to my sentiments, an
earthquake consists.

This shews the mistake of the ancients, who fancying that earthquakes
proceeded from subterraneous eruptions, built their prodigious temple of
_Diana_ at _Ephesus_, upon a boggy ground, to prevent such a disaster,
The marshy part of _Lincolnshire_, being my native country, the adjacent
fen, together with that in the isle of _Ely_, I have been perfectly
acquainted with; from one end to the other, ever since I knew any thing.
This vast extent of fenny level, from near _Cambridge_ in the south,
to near _Horncastle_ in the north, is 70 miles in length. And when I
perceiv'd, that it was, in whole, or in part, shaken by both the last
earthquakes: I could not but see, that it was no less than a demonstration
against the old notion of their cause.

6ly, Earthquakes are truly most violent, in a rocky country: because the
shock is proportionate to the solidity of the matter electrify'd. So
that rocks, cliffs, quarries, old castle walls, and strong buildings,
are most obnoxious to the concussion. The isle of _Cerigo_ was more
liable, and more rudely handled by the late earthquake; both because
it was an isle, and because it was rocky. So we must say of the late
earthquake in _Switzerland_, that split the mountain, and the old castle
wall. Whence Mr. _Johnson_ in his second letter, says, it cracked a very
strong brick-house in _Gosberton_ by _Spalding_. Dr. _Doderidge_ observes
from _Northampton_ that Dr. _Stonehouse_'s dwelling being a very strong
one, was most sensibly shaken. And throughout the whole compass of this
great earthquake, we find, both the noise, the shock, and the terror
was greatest at the churches, whose walls and bulk made more resistance
than houses. And generally speaking, the churches throughout this whole
extent have very fair, and large towers, and very many remarkable spires
all of good stone, which no doubt quiver'd very much at top, if we could
have discern'd it. This same vibration impressed on the water, meeting
with the solid of the bottom of ships, and lighters, gives that thump
felt thereon; just as in common electrifying, we feel the stroke upon the
joints of our limbs chiefly. Yet of the millions of ordinary houses, over
which it passed, not one fell. A consideration which sufficiently points
out to us, what sort of a motion this was not, what sort of a motion it
was, and whence deriv'd; not a convulsion of the bowels of the earth,
but an uniform vibration or undulation of its surface, aptly thought
like that of a musical string: or what we put a drinking glass into, by
rubbing one's finger over the edge; which yet brought to a certain pitch,
breaks the glass; undoubtedly an electric repulsion of parts. And from
this remarkable similarity in the appearance of earthquakes we gather an
invincible argument against the old opinion of their cause; for the tumult
of subterraneous eruptions can have no possible place herein.

7ly, We find from all accounts, ancient and modern, that the weather
preceding these shocks, was mild, warm, dry, serene, clear, frosty: what
notoriously favours all our electrical experiments. This is particularly
observ'd by Mr. _Johnson_ and Mr. _Smith_, and other accounts. In the
extensive shock of _sunday march_ 18, along the _Sussex_ coast, they take
notice from _Portsmouth_, that the day was serene, warm, and dry, and
that a shower of rain fell immediately before the shock. Mr. _Bowman_ of
_Moulsey_ observ'd a shock there on _may_ 24 last, and says, the air was
perfectly serene, and clear. We very well know, that generally, all last
winter spring, summer, and autumn, have been most remarkably of this kind
of weather; more so, than has been observ'd in our memory; and have had
all those requisites, appearances, and preparations, that notoriously
cause electricity, that promote it, or that are the effects of it.

8ly, We find the blood-red _australis aurora_ preceding at _Spalding_,
as with us at _London_. At the time of the earthquake at _Manchester_
this year, it accompanied it. And this year has been more remarkable than
any for fire-balls, storms, wind, thunder, lightnings, and coruscations,
almost throughout all _England_. A large ball of fire, with a long
fiery tail on _july_ 22, that passed over great part of _England_
northward. Another seen over _London_, passing from west to east, in
_october_. Coruscations were seen just before that extensive shock of
70 miles long felt from _Lancaster_ to _Wrexham_, on _april_ 2, last.
Fire-balls more than one were seen in _Rutland_, and _Lincolnshire_: and
particularly observ'd. And Mr. _Smith_ from _Peterborough_ writes, that
a fire-ball was seen the morning of the earthquake, in the upper part
of _Northamptonshire_. All these kind of meteors are rightly judg'd to
proceed from a state of electricity in the earth and atmosphere: and how
far they are actually concerned in causing earthquakes, time, and accurate
observation must inform us.

9ly, Mr. _Johnson_ in both his letters to me, on the first and second
earthquakes, at _Spalding_, remarks particularly, of their effects being
mostly spread to the north and south, and especially felt on the sea
coast. We may observe, that such is the direction of _Spalding_ river,
which both conducts, and strengthens the electric vibration: conveying it
along the sea-shore thence, up to _Boston_ channel; and so up _Boston_
river to _Lincoln_, as we discern, by casting our eye on a map.

We observe further, that the main of this second earthquake display'd
its effects along, and between the two rivers, _Welland_ and _Avon_:
and _that_ from their very origins, down to their fall into the sea. It
likewise reach'd the river _Witham_, which directed the electric stream
that way too, to _Lincoln_. For which reason, as there meeting the same
coming from _Boston_, the shock was most sensibly felt. It reach'd
likewise to the _Trent_ at _Nottingham_, which convey'd it to _Newark_.

The first electrical stroke seems to have been made on the high ground
above _Daventry_, in _Northamptonshire_; where the _Roman_ camps
are, made by _P. Ostorius_ the proprÃ¦tor. From thence it descended
chiefly eastward, and along the river _Welland_, from _Harborough_ to
_Stamford_, _Spalding_, the sea: and along the river _Avon_, or _Nen_, to
_Northampton_, _Peterborough_, _Wisbech_ to the sea. It spread itself all
over the vast level of the isle of _Ely_; further'd by very many canals,
and rivers, natural, and artificial, made for drainage. It was still
conducted eastward up _Mildenhall_ river, in _Suffolk_, to _Bury_, and the
parts adjacent. All this affair duly consider'd, is a confirmation of the
doctrine I advanc'd on this subject.

10ly, I apprehend, it was not the noise in the air, as of many cannon let
off at once, preceding the earthquake, that so much affrighted people, or
affected the sheep, the rookery at _Kensington_, the hen and chickens in
_Gray's-inn-lane_, the pigeons. It could not be barely the superficial
movement of the earth, that disturb'd them all at once. I judge it to be
the _effect_ of electricity, somewhat like what causes sea sickness; such
a sort of motion, as we are not accustomed to. So the earthquake affects
all those of weak nerves, or that have nervous complaints; obnoxious to
hysterics, colics, rheumatick pains in their joints; several women were
seized with violent head-achs, before both the shocks we felt in _London_.
It was this that gave the people a shortness of breath. Mr. _Smith_ from
_Peterborough_ speaks of a person that found himself very sick upon it.
This made the dog run whining about the room, seeking to get out: this
made the fishes leap up in the pond at _Southwark_; like as the experiment
of electrifying the fishes: it makes them sick. And this causes the birds
in cages to hide their heads under their wings, because they cannot fly
away. Which is commonly observ'd of them in _Italy_, and countries, where
earthquakes are more frequent.

11ly, I observe, the shepherd at _Kensington_ thought the motion of the
earthquake, and the sound, was from the north-west to south-east; the like
Mr. _W. Smith_ from _Peterborough_. On the contrary, Mr. _Byfield_ the
scarlet dyer in _Southwark_, thought the noise came from the river below
bridge, and went toward _Westminster_; where it rattled so, that he did
not doubt, but that the abbey-church was beaten down.

Dr. _Parsons_ took pains to find out the way of the motion of the
earthquake, from the different position of people's beds; but from the
contradictory answers given, he cou'd not obtain any satisfaction, as
to that point. All this, and what was observ'd from _Northampton_, of
the motion being thought by some, to be upward and downward; by others
rather horizontal, or lateral: the counting the pulses, and the like, only
points out to us the prodigious celerity, and the vibratory species of the
motion of an earthquake. But far, very far is this from being owing to the
tumultuous ebullition, the irregular hurry of subterraneous explosions.

12ly, How the atmosphere, and earth, are put into that electric and
vibratory state, which prepares them to give, or receive the snap, and the
shock, which we call an earthquake; what it is, that immediately produces
it, we cannot say: any more than we can define, what is the cause of
magnetism, or of gravitation; or how muscular motion is perform'd, or a
thousand other secrets in nature.

We seem to know, that the author of the world has disseminated ethereal
fire, thro' all matter, by which these great operations are brought about.
This is the subtil fluid of Sir _Isaac Newton_, pervading all things:
the occult fire diffused thro' the universe, according to _Marsilius
Ficinus_ the platonic philosopher, on the _Timeus_ of his master. All
the Platonists insist on an occult fire passing thro', and agitating all
substance, by its vigorous and expansive motion.

Before them, _Hippocrates_ writes in the same sense, _I. de victÃ»s
ratione_, that this fire moves all in all. This ethereal fire is one of
the four elements of the ancients. It lies latent, and dispersed thro'
all the other three, and quiescent: till collected into a quantity, that
over-balances the circumjacent; like the air crouded into a tempest: or
till it is excited, by any proper motion.

This fire gives elasticity: and elasticity or vibration is the mother of
electricity. We don't so much wonder at phosphorus arising from animal
substances; for this fire is in water, and betrays itself to our senses,
in salt water. Many a time when I have passed the _Lincolnshire_ washes,
in the night time; the horse has seem'd to tread in liquid flames. The
same appearance is oft at the keel of a ship. Fire exists in water, says
_Pliny_, as well as in human bodies. _nat. hist._ II. 107. Loaf sugar
beaten in the dark is luminous. Many vegetables, as indian cane, and
rotten wood the like, as _Bartholin_ largely recites, _de luce hominum_
c. 4. All electric bodies have this privilege: that is, they more easily
discover it. Amber, gum lac, naptha, bitumens, some precious stones.
My old friend Mr. _Stephen Gray_ the father and great propagator of
electricity, show'd me experiments therein, in the year 1705, then at
_Corpus Christi_ college in _Cambridge_. Afterward in the year 1719, he
show'd by experiments before the Royal Society, that paper, ribbands,
silk, sattin, cloth, shavings, linen, goldbeaters skin, and in short,
almost all kind of substances discover electrical sparks of fire in the
dark: especially when well warm'd before the fire, or in a cold, dry,
nitrous air, and in a room where there is no company. This same quality is
found _in vacuo_, as Dr. _Desaguliers_ show'd before the Royal Society,
_march_ 31, 1720. He took an exhausted glass globe, and caused it to be
turn'd round violently, in an engine: by rubbing the hand upon it, it was
illuminated within side, with purple streams. This gave foreigners the
idea of using a glass globe, in electrical experiments.

The operation of the ethereal fire is various, nay, infinite, according
to its quantity, and degree of incitement, progress, hindrance, or
furtherance. One degree keeps water fluid, says the learned bishop of
_Cloyne_: another turns it into elastic air, and air itself seems nothing
else, but vapors, and exhalations render'd elastic, by this fire.

This fame fire permeates, and dwells in all bodies; even diamond,
flint, and steel. Its particles attract with the greatest force, when
approximated. Again, when united, they fly asunder, with the greatest
force, and celerity; it resists nothing quiescent, but when put into
motion, it disdains all resistance. All this is according to the laws
prescrib'd by the sovereign architect. This is the life, and soul of
action, and reaction, in the universe. Thus has the great author provided
against the native sluggishness of matter! light, or fire in animals, is
what we call the animal spirits; and is the author of life, and motion.
But we know not the immediate mode of muscular motion; any more than how,
in inanimate matter, it causes the vibrations of an earthquake.

Of this fire, the excellent _Manilius_ thus writes, who liv'd in the time
of _Augustus_.


_Astronom._ I.

    _Sunt autem cunctis permisti partibus ignes;
     Qui gravidas habitant fabricantes fulmina nubes:
     Et penetrant terras, Ã†tnamq; imitantur Olympo:
     Et calidas reddunt ipsis in fontibus undas.
     Ac silice in duro, viridiq; in cortice sedem
     Inveniunt; cum silva sibi collisa crematur.
     Ignibus usq; adeo natura est omnis abundans!_


Which may thus be english'd.

     Fire universal nature traverses.
     It makes the thunderbolt in tumid clouds:
     In dire Vulcano's penetrates the earth:
     And sends the boiling water from its springs.
     In hardest flint, and softest wood it dwells:
     Which by collision shows itself in flame.
     With fire so pregnant is all nature found!

13ly, The great question then with us, is how the surface of the earth
is put into that vibratory and electric state, by heat and driness? we
must needs acquit the internal of the earth from the charge of these
superficial concussions. How then is the ethereal fire crouded together,
or excited, so as to cause them; seeing in our ordinary electrical
experiments, we make use of friction?

But that friction alone does not excite electricity, we know from the
obvious experiment of flint and steel, where the suddenness of the stroke,
and hardness of the matter does it. Another method of exciting it, is
the letting off a number of great guns, which so crouds the ethereal
fire together, as to electrify glass windows; observ'd by my friend the
reverend Dr. _Stephen Hales_. The _aurora borealis_, _australis_, all kind
of coruscations, meteors, lightning, thunder, fire-balls are the effects,
and may reciprocally be the cause of electricity; but how in particular
we know not. Come we to the animal world, we must needs assert, that all
motion voluntary, involuntary, generation, even life itself: all the
operations of the vegetable kingdom, and an infinity more of nature's
works, are owing to the activity of this electric fire, the very soul of
the material world. And in my opinion, 'tis this alone, that solves the
famous question, so much agitated with the writers in medicine, about the
heat of the blood. How these, how earthquakes are begun, propagated, we
are yet to seek.

We may readily enough presume, that the contact between the electric, and
the non-electric, which gives the snap, and the shock, must come from
without, from the atmosphere. Perhaps by some meteor that crouds the
ethereal fire together: which then flies off with that immense force that
causes the earthquake. In the point of contact on the earth's surface,
the same thing is done, perhaps, another time, by a shower of rain. Our
thoughts upon this matter must needs be as immature, as they are novel.
But we may readily conclude, that tho' the original stroke comes from the
atmosphere, yet the atmosphere has no further concern in it: no aereal
power, or change therein, can propagate itself so instantaneously, over
so vast a surface, as 4000 miles square. Therefore the impetuous rushing
noise in the air, accompanying the shock, is the effect, and not the
cause. And all this is strongly confirm'd by this observation, that the
barometer and thermometer receiv'd no change upon the earthquakes.

But surely, there is not a heart of flesh that is not affected with so
stupendous a concussion! let a man estimate his own power, with that which
causes an earthquake; and he will be persuaded, that somewhat more than
ordinary is intended by so rare and wonderful a motion. That great genius
_Hippocrates_, makes the whole of the animal Å“conomy to be administred,
by what we call nature. And nature alone, says he, suffices for all
things, to animals: she _knows_ herself, and what is necessary for them.
We must extend this thought to the inanimate world. And can we deny then,
that he here means a conscious and intelligent nature, that presides
over, and directs all things, moves the ethereal spirit or fire, that
moves all things: a divine necessity, but a voluntary agent, who gives
the commanding nod, to what we commonly call nature, the chief instrument
in the most important operations of the vast machine, as well as in the
ordinary ones, particularly the human one: administring the whole Å“conomy
(as he says) without noise, unseen, unfelt. And this leads us,

14ly, Lastly, in regard to the spiritual use we ought to make of these
extraordinary _phÃ¦nomena_, or of our inquiries about them, I shall first
observe, that we find abroad, several of these earthquakes this year have
been very fatal. In the last we read of, at _Philippopoli_ in _Thrace_,
the whole city was destroyed, above 4000 inhabitants killed. At home,
where above half a score separate concussions have been felt, there has
not been one house thrown down, one life lost. This ought to inspire us
with a very serious reflection about them; nor is it altogether unworthy
of our remark, that they began with us in _London_, in _february_ last:
and after visiting the circle of the globe, at present, end with us.

2dly, We may observe, that if we did but read the works of _Hippocrates_,
_Plato_ and his followers; of _Tully_, _Galen_, and the like ethic writers
of antiquity; whilst we study, and try the affections of matter; we should
improve in philosophy, properly speaking: we should lift up our minds from
these earthly wonders, and discern the celestial admonitions, they present
to us.

The original meaning of the word philosophy, was rightly apply'd to
moral wisdom. We who have advanc'd both the natural, and moral, should,
as the ancients did, join them both together. By this means, we gather,
the truth of the highest, and most excellent philosophy, to be found in
those volumes of first antiquity, which we call sacred: and which, 'tis
our peculiar, and inestimable happiness to possess. We should adore that
divine light, which they hold forth to us. Especially in a country, where
the principles of true religion are open, and undisguised: where the
establish'd profession of it is rational, noble and lovely: worthy of the
moral governor of the world; fit for him to enjoin: for us to practise,
with pleasure and effect.
