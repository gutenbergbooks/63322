<h2><span class="smaller">TO</span><br />

<i>Martin Folkes</i>, Esq; LL.D.<br />

<span class="smaller">President of the Royal Society.</span></h2>


<p class="tdr"><i>March 26, 1750.</i><br /></p>

<p>When so great and unusual a <i>phenomenon</i>,
as an earthquake, and that
repeated, happens among us; it
will naturally excite a serious reflection
in everyone that is capable of thinking.
And we cannot help considering it, both in a
philosophical and a religious view. Any mind
will take the alarm when we perceive a motion
that affects the earth, that bears the whole
city of <i>London</i>, and some miles round it.
And at the same time while it gives us so sensible
a shake, so gently sets us down again; without
damage to any buildings, and without a
life lost.</p>

<p>'Tis hard to say, which is the greater wonder.
But alas in the works of nature, there
are no degrees of great, and little; comparisons
are incompatible. We indeed are more affected
with what seems great in our own apprehensions:
I would rather say, what is rare and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1006" id="Page_1006">[1006]</a></span>
unusual. An omnipotent power admits of
no distinctions. And when prodigious effects
are produc'd from causes imperceptible, it rightly
claims our most serious attention, as well as
wonder. Nor need we lose sight of the theological
purpose of these amazing alarms; whilst
we endeavor to find out the philosophy of
them.</p>

<p>Among all the appearances of nature, which
are the subject of the inquiries of the Royal
Society, none more deserves the regard of a
contemplative mind. And among the very
numerous accounts received there, from all
quarters, being only Observations upon the
manner of it, and its extent: I judg'd, it became
us to inquire into the <i>cause</i> of so extraordinary
a motion: of which we could not form a
proper idea; had we not repeatedly seen, and
felt it.</p>

<p>The moderns have not improv'd upon the
opinions of the ancients, in this matter; any
further than by the fancied analogy of some
chymical experiments. But these chymical
experiments, and all sorts of explosions by gun-powder,
and the like, are to me a very unsatisfactory
solution they are merely artificial
compositions, which can have nothing similar
in the bowels of the earth, and they produce
their effects by violence, by rending and tearing,
by a <i>solutio continui</i>. This is indeed too
often the case of earthquakes, but <i>that</i> is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1007" id="Page_1007">[1007]</a></span>
partial degree, not at all equivalent to the compass
of the shock; and is very far from being
the constant concomitant of an earthquake.
Quite the contrary. Innumerable such happen,
when there is no breach of the surface;
and of these three or four which we have now
felt, nothing of it has appear'd. But the immensity
of the vibration of the earth which
shook every house in <i>London</i>, with impunity,
and for twenty miles round, can never, in my
apprehension, be owing to so unbridled a cause,
as any subterraneous vapours, fermentations,
rarefactions, and the like; the vulgar solution.
Nor does the kind of motion, which I discern
in an earthquake, in any sort agree with what
we should expect from explosions.</p>

<p>In order then to proceed with some degree
of certainty, in our inquiry after the cause of
earthquakes, it will be useful, in the first place,
to set in one view, the general appearances remarkable
therein; the most usual concomitants:
As we can collect them from our own
observation, or from the relations and writings
of others.</p>


<p class="caption2nb smcap gesperrt">Circumstances.</p>

<p>I. That earthquakes always happen in calm
seasons, in warm, dry, sultry weather; or after
a dry, frosty air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1008" id="Page_1008">[1008]</a></span></p>

<p>II. That they are felt at sea, as well as land,
even in the main ocean; and at that time, the
sea is calm.</p>

<p>III. That earthquakes differ very much in
magnitude. Some shake a very large tract of
country, at the same instant of time; nay, sometime
extend to very many countries, separated
by mountains, seas, lakes, the ocean.</p>

<p>IV. That earthquakes differ very much in
the quantity, of their vibratory motion: Whence
in some, tho' largely extended, they are innocuous;
in others, both small and great, they
lay all in ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>V. That a hollow, thundering, unusual
noise accompanies them, or rather seems to
preceed the shock; which rolls in the air like
the noise of cannon.</p>

<p>VI. That they are felt more sensibly in the
upper story of houses than in the lower.</p>

<p>VII. That the shock is more violent upon
more solid buildings, churches, castles, and
stone-houses, than upon those of slighter materials.</p>

<p>VIII. That many people find themselves
sick at stomach, with headake, and pains in
their joints, and the like, which sometime lasts
for the day after, or longer.</p>

<p>IX. That earthquakes generally happen to
great towns, and cities, and more particularly
to those that are situate on the sea.</p>

<p>X. That earthquakes do not cause any damage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1009" id="Page_1009">[1009]</a></span>
to springs and fountains; but the water
in wells becomes foul for a short time.</p>

<p>XI. That they are more frequent in the
neighboring countries of a vulcano.</p>

<p>This last circumstance, in my opinion, has
led all inquirers in this question, out of the
true path; therefore I propose in the ensuing
paper.</p>

<p>I. To shew what it is not; the insufficiency
of the vulgar opinion, of subterraneous fires
and vapours.</p>

<p>II. To shew what it is in reality, as it appears
to me.</p>

<p>III. I shall conclude with the moral use we
ought to make of these prodigies of nature.</p>

<p>I. The struggles of subterraneous winds and
fires, that should heave up the ground like animal
convulsions, seem to me impossible: Their
powers, and manner of acting (if such there be)
is quite incapable of producing the appearance
of an earthquake. That these should
operate instantaneously, in one minute, thro'
a circle of 30 or 40 miles diameter, or more, I
could not conceive. Nor that there should be
any possible, much less ready passage thro' the
solid earth, for such nimble agents, as every
one is apt to imagine that speak of this appearance;
without sufficiently reflecting on the insuperable
difficulties in that <i>hypothesis</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot pretend to deny that there may
be such vapours, and fermentations, inflammable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1010" id="Page_1010">[1010]</a></span>
substances, and actual fires, in the bowels
of the earth; and that there may be some
caverns under-ground, as well as we find some
few above ground: such as <i>Pool</i>'s-<i>Hole</i>, <i>The
Devil</i>'s-<i>Arse in the Peak</i> of <i>Derbyshire</i>, and
<i>Okey-Hole</i> in <i>Somersetshire</i>. These, I believe,
to have been so from the creation, never were
made by earthquakes. We know, there are
hot springs running continually: There are
some vulcano's frequently belching out flames
and smoke, and to these perhaps some earthquakes
may be owing, tho' not according to
the vulgar notion; as we shall see, by and by.</p>

<p>But these matters are very rare, much rarer
than earthquakes, both as to time and place.
<i>Vesuvius</i> in <i>Italy</i>, and in that part of it abounding
with mines of sulphur: <i>Ætna</i> in <i>Sicily</i>,
and <i>Heckla</i> in <i>Iceland</i>; these are all we know
of, in the old world. In the <i>Andes</i> mountains
of <i>America</i>, there are some. The scarcity of
these appears to me a strong argument against
the common deductions made therefrom, as
to their being the cause of earthquakes.</p>

<p>Nor can I enter into the sentiments of those
that hold the cavernous state of the earth, so
as to contribute to the forming an earthquake
by vapours running from place to place under
ground. How many thousand acres of coal-mines
do they daily work in <i>England</i>, and have done
for ages? I have been myself 2 or 300 feet deep
in a solid rock of native salt: I have walked a
mile lengthwise directly into the earth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1011" id="Page_1011">[1011]</a></span>
descending all the way, in the proportion of
one yard in five, 'till we came under the bed of
the very ocean, where ships were sailing over
our heads. This was at Sir <i>James Lowther</i>'s
coal-pit, at <i>Whitehaven</i>. We were at this
time deeper under ground by the perpendicular,
than any part of the ocean, between <i>England</i>
and <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>We never hear, from the many hundreds
of thousands of workmen in this kind, at <i>Newcastle</i>,
<i>Nottinghamshire</i>, <i>Yorkshire</i>, <i>Derbyshire</i>,
<i>Staffordshire</i>, <i>Somersetshire</i>, and <i>Wales</i>: from
the infinite numbers of workmen in the mines
of lead, tin, and the like, of the cavernous state
of the earth, so as to give any colour for this
<i>hypothesis</i> of earthquakes. The earth is generally
of solid rock; in which there must be now,
and then, some clefts, and vacuities, small in
compass, as naturally so many heterogeneous
<i>strata</i> of the earth consolidate together. But
there can be no imagination of vapours breaking
through, uniting, traversing so suddenly, a
large space of earth, so as to produce those
earthquakes, we have seen, and felt; much less
such as we read of. The workmen in all sorts
of mines confess by their hard labor, that the
earth is not cavernous; nor are there mines of
sulphur, nitre, and the like inflammable materials
in <i>England</i>. Or if there were, could they
burn, and cause convulsions of the earth, without
proper cavities, pipes, and conveyances of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1012" id="Page_1012">[1012]</a></span>
air; as vulcano's, and coal-pits, when set on
fire. But even from these coal-pits, when fired,
do we ever find any thing like an earthquake
produced. Nor do we find earthquakes frequent
in those countries, that abound with coal-mines,
as certainly would be the case, if that
<i>hypothesis</i> was just. How easy would it be, on
the slightest occasion for earthquakes to happen
in the countries abounding with coal-mines,
which are so full of artificial cavities communicating
with one another, for many miles
together: The very thing supposed, by those
who hold the old opinion, of vapours traversing
the earth for that purpose.</p>

<p>In the coal-pits, some small natural cavities
now and then are found; which when opened,
send forth a pestiferous vapor and a fire-damp
which runs for a long time together.
And tho' there are many substances that may
generate air, within the bowels of the earth;
yet these matters are infinitely unable to produce
an earthquake: Never would have force
to open a passage for themselves thro' the solid
rock, of perhaps many hundred feet in
thickness. Nor did we observe in these last
earthquakes any fire, vapour, smoke, or smell,
any kind of eruption, in the least; as must
certainly have been, in so great a struggle of
the superfice, as affected a circle of so large a
diameter. Were there such, we could scarce
hope any otherwise, than that they would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1013" id="Page_1013">[1013]</a></span>
too sensibly felt; to the destruction of many
thousands, by their pestiferous qualities.</p>

<p>Indeed this consideration alone, of the extent
of that surface, is sufficient to overthrow any
supposition, of earthquakes being chiefly owing
to subterraneous vapours: They cannot momentarily
fly under so large a tract of ground,
if they were near the outward shell of the earth.
They could not do it without breaking ground,
and discovering themselves to the sight, or
smell; and that for a long time after. It cannot
possibly be imagin'd, they could have so immense
a force, as to lift up the city of <i>London</i>,
and never be perceived by our organs, and outward
senses. We have frequent accounts of a
little fire-ball bursting in the air, at a distance;
yet it instantly propagates a sulphureous smell
around.</p>

<p>If the movement of a superficies of 30 miles
diameter was owing to fumes, and vapours;
we ought reasonably to find some great discharges
of them, belching out smoke and fire,
for a long time after, like vulcano's, and coal-pits
fir'd. The operation of the shock ought
to be of hours continuance, not instantaneous;
and the evaporation of so vast a quantity of
matter, must darken the whole region of the
air for a long time after; or require a long
time, if gradually it discharges itself. We see
how immense a volume of smoke is produc'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">[1014]</a></span>
by a very small quantity of gun-powder; and
no vapour could be so subtle, that produc'd
such effects, and not be very obvious to our
senses.</p>

<p>Even in vulcano's, it is the opinion of the
learned <i>Italian</i> philosopher <i>Borelli</i>, and of
other great naturalists, that they are kindled
first from the surface, where there is a possibility
of ventilation from the air. They
imagine, it begins at the top of the mountains;
not by any fancied fermentation of the <i>pyrites</i>
and sulphureous vapours arising from subterraneous
caverns, in the lower parts of
mountains.</p>

<p>There is another consideration, which utterly
overthrows these suppositions, of earthquakes
being caused by anything under-ground; and
that is a due consideration of springs, and fountains
perpetually flowing; and that from the
creation of the world to this day. If we would
form any tolerable idea of their nature, we
must needs conceive, that God Almighty has
laid their pipes, and canals in the earth, from a
great depth, even to the surface; like as he has
planted the veins, arteries, and glands in an
animal body. And likewise that they are more
and more ramify'd, as they nearer approach
the outward shell of the earth; just so our
veins, and arteries, as they come nearer the skin.</p>

<p>The workmen in coal-mines, and those of
metals, minerals, and stone-quarries, never fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1015" id="Page_1015">[1015]</a></span>
to meet with springs, and currents of water,
every where. Often they ruin, and divert
springs another way, only by digging into
the earth for foxes, and the like. Whenever
they dig for wells, in any kind of earth, they
commonly find springs. The colliers, and
workers of mines, are oblig'd to drain the
waters off with very great expence.</p>

<p>These are circumstances not favorable to
subterraneous fires being in the earth in abundance;
much less to their being the cause of
earthquakes. And further, we cannot possibly
think of earthquakes doing their work
that way, without absolutely ruining the
whole system of springs, and fountains,
throughout the whole country, where they
pass. But all this is quite contrary to fact;
even where an earthquake has been repeatedly.
For an instance from home.</p>

<p>On <i>Wednesday, April</i> 6, 1580, about six
in the evening, just such another earthquake
was felt in <i>London</i> and around it, as these
two we have seen. Another exactly similar
1692. In all these four, no houses thrown
down, no springs disturb'd thereby, no sensible
eruptions nor smells.</p>

<p>These considerations I apply only to this
little inconsiderable space, of a circle 30 miles
diameter; as with us. But what is that to
the earthquakes we read of in history? In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1016" id="Page_1016">[1016]</a></span>
the year of our Lord 17, no less than thirteen
great and noble cities in <i>Asia minor</i>, were destroyed
in one night. <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and many
other authors mention it. The fact is so notorious,
that some persons here present, have seen a
vast block of white marble now standing near
<i>Naples</i>; being the pedestal of a coloss statue
of <i>Tiberius</i> the emperor; having carv'd on it
the <i>genius's</i>, or pictures of all those cities,
with their names. The accurate <i>Bulifon</i> and
others have wrote treatises upon it. These
cities were rebuilt by that emperor. But
without going so far, we may see another
evidence of it, a coin of that emperor struck
upon the occasion, with this inscription,</p>

<p class="tdc gesperrt">
CIVITATIBUS ASIAE RESTITUTIS.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">I have one of them, in large brass, which
was found at <i>Colchester</i>.</p>

<p>The compass of this earthquake may be
reckon'd to take up 300 miles diameter, as
a circle. Now, we cannot conceive, how
any subterraneous vapour can produce such an
effect, as instantaneously to demolish all these
cities; and that such an accident should never
happen after. That the whole country of
<i>Asia minor</i> should not at the same time be
destroy'd, its mountains be renversed, its
fountains, springs, and rivers broken up and
ruin'd for ever. Instead whereof we find nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1017" id="Page_1017">[1017]</a></span>
suffered, but those cities; no kind of
alteration in the surface of the country; it remains
the same as it were in the beginning
of time. In 1586 an earthquake in <i>Peru</i>,
that extended 900 miles.</p>

<p>From these considerations, I cannot persuade
myself, to enter into the opinion of vapours,
and eruptions being the cause sought
for; and, after we have treated the argument
in a superficial view, we must go a little
deeper.</p>

<p>If we would consider things like philosophers,
let us propose to ourselves this problem: Where
is the power to be plac'd, that is requir'd to
move a surface of earth 30 miles in diameter?</p>

<p>To answer this, consult the ingineers, and
those that make mines in the sieges of towns;
they will acquaint us, that the effect of mines
is produced in form of an inverted cone. And
that a diameter of 30 miles, in the base, will
require an <i>axis</i> of 15 or 20 miles to operate
upon that base, so as to shake it, at least.
Now the vapours, or whatever power we
propose to operate, according to the foregoing
requisite, in order to form the appearance
of an earthquake, must be 15 or 20 miles
deep in the earth. But what mind can conceive,
that any natural power is able to move
an inverted cone of solid earth, whose base is
30 miles diameter, whose axis 20? or was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1018" id="Page_1018">[1018]</a></span>
it possible; would not the whole texture of
that body of earth be quite disturb'd and shatter'd,
especially in regard to its springs and
fountains? but nothing like this is ever found
to be the consequence of an earthquake, tho'
fatal to cities.</p>

<p>Apply this reasoning to the earthquake of
<i>Asia minor</i>, and this vigorous principle at the
<i>apex</i> of the cone must lie, at least, 200 Miles
deep in the ground. Enough to show the absurdity
of any moving power plac'd under the
Earth! A cone of 300 miles diameter at
base, 200 miles <i>axis</i>: I dare be bold to say,
that all the gun-powder made since its invention,
if put together and fired, would not be able
to move it; how much less pent up vapours?
what must we say of a circle of 900 miles
diameter?</p>

<p>But, could that be admitted as possible,
would any one be persuaded, that such a subterraneous
tumult, of so vast an extent, will
be no ways injurious to the internal system of
springs and fountains, and that this shall often
be repeated without the least damage? We
may as well imagine, that we can stab a man
100 times and never touch vein or artery.</p>

<p>Since I gave in my two papers to the Royal
Society, a letter of Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>'s has been
printed, which abundantly confirms my sentiments.
The whole drift of it is, to show
how invalid is the vulgar idea conceiv'd, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1019" id="Page_1019">[1019]</a></span>
earthquakes arising from subterraneous vapours
and eruptions: That the earth itself is not
moved to any depth, and that the shock must
arise from the atmosphere. The circumstances
which he has judiciously collected, are extremely
agreeable to mine; many of them
the very same, strongly confirming my <i>hypothesis</i>:
And had that great man known the
properties of electricity, which we are now
masters of, he would have prevented me in
this affair.</p>

<p>"Considering (says he) what variety of
substances, sand, gravel, stones, rock, minerals,
clay, and mold, our earth is compounded
of, and how little nitre, or explosive
matter, a large quantity thereof will
afford; I cannot think, where we can
find matter enough to move so vast a bulk
of earth, as all the South parts of <i>England</i>,
all the <i>Netherlands</i>, with part of
<i>Germany</i>, all <i>France</i>, and perhaps <i>Italy</i>,
(which were shock'd at once the 8th of
<i>September</i> last 1692;) or part of <i>Asia</i>, and
near all <i>Europe</i>, which trembled together
the same day, 91 years before.</p>

<p>"But, allowing there may have been sufficient
matter prepared for these purposes,
I can hardly think, there are continued cavities,
at any reasonable depth, all under
<i>Europe</i>, wherein an explosion being made,
might shake the whole at once, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1020" id="Page_1020">[1020]</a></span>
make no clefts, or separations, in those
parts where the minerals and mountainous
rocks part from the light mold and clay.
If an hundred barrels of gun-powder could
be fixed in some cave, a thousand yards
under ground; allowing the force of the
explosion sufficient to raise all the weight
of earth incumbent on the cavern; it
would certainly break the loose mold
from any large solid rock we may conceive
adjacent, and leave at least some clefts behind
it. But we seldom or never hear of
such clefts, made in such places, when
earthquakes happen."</p>

<p>Again, he writes thus: "I cannot apprehend,
(if all earthquakes must be made by
explosions in subterraneous caverns) why
sometimes a large country, or whole continent,
should be thereby shook all at once;
why there should be no eruptions in the
neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>From all circumstances consider'd, he concludes,
that the abstruse, effective cause of
them comes from the air; and that a calm is
necessary before an earthquake. And these
two particulars are likewise Dr. <i>Hales</i>'s positions:
"The earth-lightning, as he calls it,
is first kindled on the surface, and not at
great depths, as has been thought; whose
explosion is the immediate cause of an
earthquake. He says, long, dry, hot seasons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1021" id="Page_1021">[1021]</a></span>
are usually the preparatory forerunners
of earthquakes." From all these considerations
I conclude; earthquakes are not
caus'd by subterraneous vapors.</p>

<p>II. We are to inquire, what is the cause of
earthquakes.</p>

<p>In an age when electricity has been so
much our entertainment, and our amazement;
when we are become so well acquainted
with its stupendous powers and properties,
its velocity, and instantaneous operation
through any given distance; when we see,
upon a touch, or an approach, between a
non-electric and an electrified body, what a
wonderful vibration is produc'd! what a snap
it gives! how an innocuous flame breaks
forth! how violent a shock! Is it to be wonder'd
at, that hither we turn our thoughts, for
the solution of the prodigious appearance of
an earthquake?</p>

<p>Here is at once an assemblage of all those
properties and circumstances which we so
often see in courses of electricity. Electricity
may be call'd a sort of soul to matter,
thought to be an ethereal fire pervading all
things; and acting instantaneously, where,
and as far as it is excited. 'Tis every body's
observation, that there never was a winter,
like the last past, in any one's memory, so
extremely remarkable for warmth and driness,
abounding with thunder and lightning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1022" id="Page_1022">[1022]</a></span>
very uncommon in winter; coruscations in
the air frequent, justly thought electrical by
all philosophers; particularly, twice we had
the extraordinary appearance of that called
<i>aurora australis</i>, with colours altogether unusual;
and this just before the first earthquake:
All the while the wind constantly
south and south-west, and that without rain,
which is unusual with these winds.</p>

<p>This state of the atmosphere had continued
five months before the first earthquake. Is it
not hence reasonable to conclude, that the
earth, especially in our region, must be
brought into an unusual state of electricity;
into that vibratory condition wherein electricity
consists; and, consequently, nothing was
wanting but the approach of a non-electric
body, to produce that snap, and that shock,
which we call an earthquake; a vibration of
the superficies of the earth.</p>

<p>That the earth was in that vibratory and
electric state we have further reason to conclude,
from the very extraordinary forwardness
of all the vegetable world with us.
Every one knows, that, at the end of <i>February</i>,
all sorts of garden-stuff, trees, fruits,
and flowers, were as forward as in other years,
by the middle of <i>April</i>. Conformable to
which, experiments abundantly show, that
electrifying of plants quickens their growth,
equally as in animals it quickens the pulse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1023" id="Page_1023">[1023]</a></span>
Nor will the unusual driness and warmth of
the weather solely account for such a precipitate
vegetation: because a necessary supply of
rain was wanting, as in the natural Spring-season.</p>

<p>A very long dry frost will produce the
same electrical state of the earth, as it equally
favours electrical experiments. Thus,
<i>March</i> 27, 1076, a frost from the 1st of
<i>November</i> to the middle of <i>April</i>, a general
earthquake in <i>England</i> succeeded. <i>Matt. Paris.</i>
That of <i>Oxford</i>, 17th of <i>September</i>
1683, was after a frost. <i>Jan.</i> 4, 1680, An
earthquake in <i>Somersetshire</i>: The air was very
calm; a frosty night.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> concurs with us, in our first
position, That earthquakes always happen in
<i>calm</i> seasons. He adds, "That <i>Keckerman</i>,
a learned author, who wrote on the subject,
affirms, and backs it from the authority
of <i>Aristotle</i> and <i>Pliny</i>."</p>

<p>The 8th of <i>September</i> 1601 was a very
calm day but cloudy: And the <i>Smyrna</i> merchants
observe the earthquakes there happen
in calm, still weather. The remarkable clearness
and calmness of the morning was observed
in that of <i>Oxford</i> 17th of <i>September</i>
1683, and the air continued so for five or six
days after: Therefore we may infer, that it
is not impossible, what has been abundantly
related, that some foreigners from <i>Italy</i> here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1024" id="Page_1024">[1024]</a></span>
in <i>England</i>, some from the <i>West-Indies</i> (in
both which countries earthquakes are more
frequent than with us) did seem to apprehend
our first earthquakes from the apparent temper
of the weather; and observations of this
kind are as old as <i>Aristotle</i>. It is observed
in <i>Jamaica</i>, when the air is extraordinary
calm, an earthquake is always apprehended.</p>

<p>We had lately read at the Royal Society,
a very curious discourse, from Mr. <i>Franklin</i>
of <i>Philadelphia</i>, concerning thundergusts,
lightning, the northern lights, and meteors.
All which he rightly solves from the
doctrine of electricity. For, if a cloud raised
from the sea, which is a non-electric, happens
to touch a cloud raised from exhalations
of the land, when electrified, it must immediately
cause thunder and lightning. The
electrical fire flowing from the touch of perhaps
a thousand miles compass of clouds,
makes that appearance, which we call lightning.
The snap which we hear in our electrical
experiments, when re-echoed from
cloud to cloud, the extent of the firmament,
makes that affrightning sound of thunder.</p>

<p>From the same principle I infer, that, if a
non-electric cloud discharges its contents upon
any part of the earth, when in a high electrified
state, an earthquake must necessarily
ensue. The ship made upon the contact of
many miles compass of solid earth is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1025" id="Page_1025">[1025]</a></span>
horrible uncouth noise, which we hear upon
an earthquake; and the shock is the earthquake
itself.</p>

<p>In the relation received from <i>Portsmouth</i>,
and the <i>Isle of Wight</i>, concerning the last
shock there, on the 18th of <i>March</i>, the writer
observes, the Day was warm and serene;
but, upon a gentle shower falling in the evening,
the earthquake came. Here we have
reason to apprehend the electrified state of the
earth, and the touch of the non-electric:
which caused the earthquake.</p>

<p>The learned Dr. <i>Childrey</i> observes, treating
on this subject, that earthquakes happen
upon rain; a sudden shower of rain in the
time of a great drought.</p>

<p>'Tis objected, that, if this was the case,
nothing would be more frequent than earthquakes;
but these two circumstances concurring,
a shower and dry weather, must not
necessarily cause it, any more than touching
a tube before it is electrified causes a snap.
The earth must be in a proper electrified state
to produce it; and electricity has its fits; is
remitted, intended, ceased and recommenced.
It has its bounds. All causes must concur.
And now, with us, all necessary causes did
so apparently. Tho' a shower of rain falling
upon the earth when electrified, may cause
an earthquake, yet too much rain before, will
prevent that state of electricity, necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">[1026]</a></span></p>

<p>The day before the catastrophe of <i>Port-Royal</i>,
the weather was remarkably serene and
clear. In that most dreadful earthquake, 1692,
of <i>Sicily</i>, where 54 cities and towns, beside a
great number of villages were destroy'd; but
especially the whole city of <i>Catania</i>: It was
preceded by a most agreeable, serene and warm
season, which was the more observable on account
of its being unusual at that time of the
year.</p>

<p>I have been inform'd, that in the morning
of both earthquakes last past with us, the air
was serene and calm; on the morning before
that 8th of <i>February</i>, the air was observ'd to
be remarkably calm; and that a little before,
a black cloud appear'd over great part of the
horizon. Dr. <i>Hales</i>, in his relation, says, the
Centinels in <i>St. James's Park</i>, and others who
were abroad in the morning of the last earthquake,
observ'd a large black cloud, and some
coruscations, just before the shock, and that it
was very calm weather: And that, in the history
of earthquakes, they generally begin in
calm weather, with a black cloud.</p>

<p>This observation precludes the suspicion of
earthquakes arising from tumults and commotions
in the upper, or under region of the
air. The remarkable clearness of the air before
earthquakes, observ'd by all, shows evidently
how free it is from vapours and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[1027]</a></span></p>

<p>Agreeable to our <i>fifth</i> position, Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>
writes, "A hollow noise in the air always
precedes an earthquake, so near that
it rather seems to accompany them. He
refers us to <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, N<sup>o</sup>
151. p. 311. The noise was heard by
many that liv'd in the out-streets, and alleys
of <i>London</i>, remote from the noise and
tumult of the greater streets."</p>

<p>This he speaks of that felt in <i>London</i> 1692;
but now the whole city heard the noise, on
both these earthquakes of ours.</p>

<p>The gardener, who gave a relation to the
Royal Society of what he observed in the
<i>Temple</i>-garden, took notice, that first he heard
the most dreadful noise imaginable, which he
thought to be a great discharge of ship-guns,
on the river: and that the noise rolled from
the water-side towards <i>Temple-bar</i>, rather before
the nodding of the houses.</p>

<p>The gentleman who observed it about <i>Hartingfordbury</i>,
says, the noise preceded the
shock. And this is a common observation,
which at once both strengthens our opinion of
electricity, and confutes that of subterraneous
vapours; for, in the latter case, the concussion
must precede the noise.</p>

<p>Agreeable to out <i>second</i> position, Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>
writes, "That earthquakes are felt at
sea, equally as on land. Our merchants
say, that, tho' the water in the bay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[1028]</a></span>
<i>Smyrna</i> lies level and smooth as a pond;
yet ships riding there feel the shocks very
sensibly, but in a very different manner
from the houses at land: For they heave
not, but tremble; their masts shiver, as if
they would fall to pieces and their guns
start in their carriages, though the surface of
the sea lies all the time calm and unmoved."
In Dr. <i>Hook</i>'s <i>Philosophical Collections</i>, N<sup>o</sup> 6.
p. 185. we are told, "That a ship felt a
shock in the main ocean; that the passengers,
who had been asleep in their cabins,
came upon deck in a fright, fearing the
ship had struck upon some rock; but, on
heaving the lead, found themselves out of
soundings."</p>

<p>All this is extremely agreeable to our assumption.
The water receives the electrical
touch, and vibratory intestine motion of its
parts, as well as land. And the impression
may be made solely on the writer a non-electric,
by the touch of an electric fire-ball, or
the like; and that seems to have been often
the care. The proper vibratory motion is
impress'd on the water without ruffling its
surface; and so communicated to all the parts
of the ship, gives the sense of a shock to the
bottom, the shivering to the mast, and the
rest of the symptoms: which sufficiently proclaim
the cause of it to be an electrical impression
upon the water. The president mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[1029]</a></span>
a relation of a waterman, that felt it
in his boat upon the river; he thought it like
a great thump at the bottom of the boat.
And so the ships at sea fancy, they strike upon
a rock.</p>

<p>This makes us apprehend, the reason of
the fishes leaping up out of the canal in <i>Southwark</i>,
of which we had an account. So in
that of <i>Oxford</i>, 1683, one fishing in the
<i>Charwell</i> felt his boat tremble under him, and
the lesser fishes seem'd affrighted by an unusual
skipping. That electricity is the cause
sought for, seems deducible from this consideration.
Several writers on earthquakes assimilate
these vibrations of the earth to those
of a musical string. Experiments have shown,
that fishes in water may be killed by the particular
tone of a musical string; and 'tis
known, that electricity will kill animals. They
assuredly felt the vibratory motion in the water,
which they were absolutely strangers to
before. No doubt it made them sick; as
those of weak nerves on land. And this circumstance
alone precludes any suspicion of
subterraneous fires under the ocean. Or, if
we were to admit of it, would the boiling of
the water exhibit any appearance, like what
we are speaking of, either to the water, or to
the ship?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> likewise concurs in our <i>eighth</i>
position, "That many people found themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">[1030]</a></span>
suddenly sick at stomach, and their
heads dizzy and light; so that those that had
formerly fits of apoplexies, dreaded their
return; particularly, one gentleman, a surgeon,
feeling himself so affected, and fearing
a return of his apoplexy, resolved to
be let blood, without suspecting the earthquake."</p>

<p>After these two shocks which we felt, many
people had pains in their joints and back, as
after electrifying; many had sickness, headakes,
hysteric and nervous disorders, and
colicks, for the whole day after, and some
much longer, especially people of weak
nerves, weak constitutions; some women
miscarry'd upon it; to some it has prov'd
fatal.</p>

<p>To this we must attribute, that relation we
had, of the dog lying asleep before the fire;
but upon the earthquake, he suddenly rose
up, run about the room, whining, and endeavouring
to get out.</p>

<p>Any solid matter is capable of being put
into a state or electricity, such as iron guns;
and the more so, by reason of their solidity.
And in proportion to it, is the greatness of
the snap, and of the shock; and a kind of
lambent flame issues from the point of contact;
and likewise somewhat of a sulphureous
smell: So that if both flame and smell were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">[1031]</a></span>
discernible in an earthquake; 'tis to be found,
without going to the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Hales</i> mentions, that solid bodies are
the best conductors of aereal lightning; whence
oaks are rent, and iron melted. And in
our earthquakes in <i>London</i>, the loudest noise
was heard near such large stone buildings, as
churches, with lofty steeples. From the top
of these we must apprehend, that the electrical
explosion goes off into the open air; as
in our experiments, from the point of swords,
and the like.</p>

<p>The electrical shock is proportionate to the
solid electrified, agreeable to our <i>seventh</i> position.
This fully accounts for earthquakes in
general, and for many in particular. What
can be imagin'd greater than a shock of the
body of the earth? 'Tis greater, or less in
proportion to the state of electrification. And
now we can account for several appearances.
In the first earthquake, the Lord Chancellor,
Masters in Chancery, and several Judges, were
sitting in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, with their backs
to the wall of the upper-end, which is of a
vast thickness. They all relate the severity of
the shock, from the wall seeming to push towards
them with great violence.</p>

<p>And thus in the earthquake of 1692, <i>Deal</i>
castle is one of them built by <i>Henry</i> VIII.
the walls are of immense thickness, and
strength; yet they shook so sensibly, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1032" id="Page_1032">[1032]</a></span>
people living in it, expected it was falling on
their heads. And this is the case in all earthquakes:
the more substantial the building, the
more violent is the shock: exactly the mode of
electrical vibration. And this Dr. <i>Hales</i> takes
notice of and others; that an earthquake shatters
rocks of marble, more easily than the
<i>strata</i> of sand, earth, or gravel. In the earthquake
here of 1692, a great cliff fell down
near <i>Dover</i>; and part of <i>Saltwood</i>-castle
wall.</p>

<p>'Tis from hence we account for that observation,
that when we electrify any person;
upon a touch, the pain and blow of the shock
is felt at the joints, the wrist, elbow, and
shoulder, for instance, more than in the intermediate
parts; because <i>there</i> is the greatest
quantity of solid.</p>

<p>At the same time, that the force of electricity
in solids, is as the quantity of matter:
we see most evidently, by innumerable experiments,
that water is equally assistant in
strengthening, and conveying the force of electricity;
and <i>that</i> in proportion too to its quantity.
And hence is to be deduc'd the reason
of my observation; that the most frequent
and dreadful earthquakes have fallen upon maritime
places. And I find the same is taken
notice of in some degree, by <i>Acosta</i>, by <i>Dolittle</i>,
who wrote on that in 1692, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1033" id="Page_1033">[1033]</a></span></p>

<p>In the dreadful catastrophe at <i>Port-Royal</i>
then, 'tis notorious, that its violence was chiefly
near the sea. So <i>Lima</i> could not suffer without
its port of <i>Callao</i>. Even in those so lately
felt by us, they were sensibly more violent
towards the river, than farther from it.</p>

<p>In that earthquake which was felt in <i>England</i>,
in the year 1692, (which was very
much like these with us) there were no
houses thrown down, nor persons kill'd: but
it reach'd more particularly <i>Sheerness</i>, <i>Sandwich</i>,
<i>Deal</i>, <i>Dover</i>, <i>Portsmouth</i>, and the maritime
parts of <i>Holland</i>, <i>Flanders</i>, and <i>Normandy</i>.</p>

<p>In this that happened on <i>Sunday</i> the 18th
of <i>March</i> last, at <i>Bath</i>; it was felt particularly
and strongly at <i>Portsmouth</i>, seven miles
above and below it, on the sea-side; all round
the isle of <i>Wight</i>, at <i>Southampton</i>, the sea-coast
of <i>Selsey</i>, south of <i>Chichester</i>, <i>Arundel</i>,
and the whole coast of <i>Sussex</i>, without going
up the land; and across the sea to the islands
of <i>Jersey</i> and <i>Guernsey</i>.</p>

<p>On <i>Monday</i> night, the 2d of this instant
<i>April</i>, 1750, at ten o'clock, at <i>Leverpool</i>, a
shock of an earthquake. And felt in several
other places in the neighbourhood; but particularly
at <i>Chester</i>, and <i>Warington</i>.</p>

<p>If we look into ancient history, we find
197 years before Christ, an earthquake shook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1034" id="Page_1034">[1034]</a></span>
terribly the isle of <i>Rhodes</i>, damag'd many
cities: and some quite swallow'd up.</p>

<p>Seventeen years before Christ, many cities
in the isle of <i>Cyprus</i> destroy'd.</p>

<p>Six years before Christ, the isle of <i>Coos</i>
vehemently afflicted.</p>

<p>During the <i>Peloponnesian</i> war among the
<i>Greeks</i>, the isle of <i>Delos</i> shaken, and the most
beautiful temple of <i>Apollo</i> thrown down.</p>

<p>Soon after, the city of <i>Lacedæmon</i> totally
destroy'd.</p>

<p><i>A. D.</i> 79. Three cities in <i>Cyprus</i> overthrown.</p>

<p><i>A. D.</i> 82. The city of <i>Smyrna</i> ruined.</p>

<p>In the time of <i>Valens</i> the emperor, a terrible
earthquake in <i>Crete</i>, whereby 100 cities
were destroy'd.</p>

<p><i>Feb.</i> 13, 1247, An earthquake, chiefly felt
in the <i>Thames</i>. <i>Matt. Paris.</i></p>

<p><i>May</i>, 1382, A general earthquake, which
did much mischief; the <i>Friday</i> following one
less; the <i>Saturday</i> following, one felt mostly
by water. <i>Henry de Knyhton.</i> <i>Holinshed.</i></p>

<p><i>A. D.</i> 1456, In the city of <i>Naples</i>, 40,000
people lost.</p>

<p><i>Constantinople</i> has often suffer'd; particularly
in 1509, 13,000 people overwhelm'd.</p>

<p>1531, At <i>Lisbon</i>, 1400 houses thrown
down; as many shatter'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1035" id="Page_1035">[1035]</a></span></p>

<p><i>April</i>, 1690, The <i>Leeward-Islands</i>, <i>Montserat</i>,
<i>Nevis</i>, and <i>Antigua</i>: At <i>Martinico</i>,
and the <i>French</i> islands, at St. <i>Lucia</i>, &amp;c. a
violent earthquake.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 8, 1703, An earthquake at <i>Hull</i>, a
perfect calm.</p>

<p>1702, At <i>Stroution</i>, in <i>Argyleshire</i>, which
extended all along the west coast of <i>Great-Britain</i>;
but to no breadth on land.</p>

<p><i>Oct.</i> 25, 1734, At <i>Havant</i>, in <i>Sussex</i>, considerable,
the air perfectly calm.</p>

<p>But instances enough, to show what I
aim'd at, that maritime places are most subject;
which is a strong argument in favour of
electricity; when both the solid of the earth,
and the quantity of the water concur, to
make the shock; exactly as in electrical experiments;
when the bottle of water is held in
the hand.</p>

<p>Thus when our mind is discharged of the
prejudices of former notions, we discern,
that every appearance favours the principle we
go upon. That, agreeable to Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>,
subterraneous explosions, could they pervade,
and traverse the earth at pleasure, must at last
burst, and disperse every thing in their way.
Yet 'tis not possible for us to imagine, such
a kind of vibration should follow, either by
sea or land, as that we are treating of. But
electricity compleatly answers it. This accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1036" id="Page_1036">[1036]</a></span>
for that superficial movement of the
earth, that universal instantaneous shock,
which made every house in <i>London</i> to tremble,
none to fall: That quivering, tremulous,
horizontal vibration, highly different from any
motion we must conceive, to be produc'd
from subterraneous evaporations. Hence authors
tell us, <i>Dec.</i> 30, 1739, describing an
earthquake in the west-riding of <i>Yorkshire</i>:
It seem'd as if the earth mov'd backward and
forward horizontally; a quivering, with reciprocal
vibrations.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> rightly accounts the motion
of earthquakes to be undulatory; and by being
continued, causes a like motion to a great
distance. As when you strike a long stretch'd
string of wire at one end, the motion is immediately
continued to the other. So far he
entered into the nature of electricity.</p>

<p>Tho' he be in the right, thinking the cause
comes from the air, yet what follows, contradicts
his own hypothesis. For if a calm be
necessary before an earthquake; then 'tis not
produc'd by any turbulence in the air. Nor
can we imagine that any aerial commotion,
tho' it may shake windows, chimneys, and
the like, shall reach 500 miles distance, split
the solid earth, destroy whole cities, and cause
those dire desolations we hear of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1037" id="Page_1037">[1037]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> mentions a circumstance, that
the earthquake here in 1692, was not felt in
the north of <i>England</i>, nor in all <i>Scotland</i>:
for rain fell that day in both. We may very
readily conceive, the earth there was not in
an electrified state; and the rain would sufficiently
prevent it. We hence understand,
how the southern regions should be more subject
to them, than our northern; where the
warmth, and driness of the air, so necessary
to electricity, is more frequent than with
us.</p>

<p>From electric vibration only can we account
for our <i>tenth</i> position, of springs, and
fountains being no ways damag'd by earthquakes:
The motion goes no deeper into the
earth, than the force and quantity of the
shock reaches; which generally is not far;
yet it proceeds lower down when the ready
passage of a well offers, and <i>there</i> affects the
water contained in it; puts it into an intestine
vibration, as to foul it, and raise mud from
the bottom.</p>

<p>It may seem difficult to conceive, how a large
portion of the earth's surface should be thus
capable of electrification. This difficulty is
lessened by reflecting on the nature of electricity,
and of the electrical, ethereal fluid pervading
all things: how it is excited by the
little motion of a small revolving glass globe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">[1038]</a></span>
By this we electrify the most solid bodies, to
the greatest distance, and with a velocity equal
to that of lightning.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Hales</i> observes, that the usual explosion
of the cannon on great days, in St. <i>James</i>'s-<i>Park</i>,
is observ'd to electrify the glass, in the
windows of the Treasury.</p>

<p>We must conceive, that when the electric
shock is communicated to one part of the
earth, it extends itself proportionably to the
force of the shock, and to the quantity of
electrified surface; and to the quality of the
matter more or less susceptible of it, more or
less apt to propagate it.</p>

<p>Set 1000 men in a row; let every one
communicate with those next him by an iron-wire
held in their hands: on an electrical
shock they all feel it alike, at the same instant;
and this gives us a very good idea of
the earthquake.</p>

<p>When the earth is broken up in any large
degree, 'tis by the sea-side; where sometimes
on a bold shore, whole streets tumble into the
sea, or into the gaping earth, now falling toward
the sea. Sometimes on a flat and sandy
shore, whole streets are rolled along the level
into the sea.</p>

<p>I am not sensible of any real objection
against our <i>hypothesis</i>, but this, being the
<i>eleventh</i> of my positions, or circumstances.
It seems true, that earthquakes are more frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1039" id="Page_1039">[1039]</a></span>
in <i>Italy</i>, near <i>Vesuvius</i>, and by <i>Ætna</i>,
in <i>Sicily</i>. And the cause seems apparently
owing to these vulcano's. At first sight, every
one would think so, but not from the true
reason. This has given the great prejudice to
the judgments of the curious, even at this
day. But consider the matter impartially, and
it will appear, so far from being a strong argument
in favour of subterraneous eruptions,
that it ought to be esteem'd a convincing proof
to the contrary, and most cogent in favour of
my principle. In strictest logic, there is no
inference to be made from particulars to generals.
Quite the contrary. We have but
these two or three vulcano's on one quarter
of the globe, and two of them toward the
warmer climate of it; whereas earthquakes
are innumerable, especially in those of a warmer
clime. That there are no vulcano's, no
discharges of fire and smoke for a continuance,
and abundance, after earthquakes; no suspicion
of it either from sight or smell, as we
know by innumerable examples, as well as in
our own country, and experience: is demonstration,
that this is not the cause. If
the vulcano's were the real cause of earthquakes,
we ought assuredly to expect, that in
the countries thereabouts, the earthquakes
ought to be far more extensive than those in
other countries, where are no vulcano's; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">[1040]</a></span>
this is altogether contrary to experience. For,
as the celebrated naturalist <i>Buffon</i> observes,
such are not extensive, as are near <i>Ætna</i> and
<i>Vesuvius</i>. He further adds: <i>Histoire naturelle</i>,
tom. <span class="smcap">I</span>. p. 508. speaking, among many
others, of a <i>vulcano</i> in the island of <i>Ternate</i>,
he remarks, "That this burning gulph is less
agitated when the air is calm, and the season
mild, than in storms and hurricanes;"
and says, "This confirms what I have said in
my foregoing discourse, and seems evidently
to prove, that the fire which makes <i>vulcano's</i>
comes not from the bottom of mountains,
but from the tops, or at least from
a very little depth; and that the hearth (or
floor) of the fire is not far from the summit
of the <i>vulcano's</i>; for, if this was not
the case, great winds could not contribute
to their conflagration." And this, in general,
is a corroborative proof of my whole hypothesis.
For there can be no great fire in
the earth, where there is no great conveyance
of air.</p>

<p>We have one vulcano in the cold region of
<i>Iceland</i>, and there is sometimes an earthquake
there; but, in the countries of that northern
latitude, and those of lesser, 'tis obvious in
all history, that earthquakes are less frequent
than in the more southern. Therefore 'tis
easy, and very natural to conclude, from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1041" id="Page_1041">[1041]</a></span>
considerations weighed together, that these
vulcano's help to put the earth about them,
into that vibratory state and condition of electricity,
which is the requisite in my <i>hypothesis</i>,
and by that means only, promote a frequency
of earthquakes there.</p>

<p>I have only one circumstance to add, which
may seem not inconsiderable; probably perceived
by many, tho' not taken notice of.
For a whole week before the first earthquake,
the partition wainscot of my house (between
the forward and backward rooms) made an
odd kind of tremulous, crackling noise continually,
as if the wainscot would split; or
as if some damage was apprehended to the
house. This was observ'd by the family,
with a good deal of concern. <i>That</i> in the
chamber crackled more than that below. We
never perceiv'd it before, nor since; and apparently,
it shows the vibratory state of the
surface of the earth, at that time.</p>

<p>But whether our conjectures upon this important
subject be well founded or no, it certainly
becomes a christian philosopher, whilst
he is investigating material causes, to look
up, and regard the moral use of them. For
in reality, every thing, the whole world, was
ultimately for that purpose made. When
we see such a kind of spirituality impress'd
on mere matter, as this amazing property of
electricity, it should kindle in us a high ambition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1042" id="Page_1042">[1042]</a></span>
of asserting, and exerting the infinitely
superior value, and powers, and excellency of
the spiritual part of us, destin'd to an immortal
duration. And of all the great and public
calamities, which affect us mortals, earthquakes
claim the first title to the name of
warnings and judgments. None so proper to
threaten, or to execute vengeance upon a
guilty people. Nor has any other, those annexed
terrors, so much of the unusual, the
unavoidable, the sudden and the horrible apprehension
of being crush'd to death, or buried
alive. And when in our own sight, these
rare and extraordinary <i>phænomena</i> appear, it
cannot but be a lesson to us, to do our duty
toward that great Being, who, by a drop of
water, can produce effects so prodigious.</p>

<p>That earthquakes proclaim themselves to
mankind in this light, is further deducible
from this observation, the <i>ninth</i> in our recapitulation
of circumstances; that they are peculiarly
directed to great cities, and maritime
towns, those nurseries of wealth, luxury, and
of all the evils naturally flowing therefrom.
It would be childish to rehearse from old history,
or modern, a proof of it. We have
no other notices of them. Look upon these
two shocks we have here felt. We own
that <i>Hampsted-heath</i>, and <i>Finchley-forest</i>, and
<i>Kennington-common</i> were affected with it;
yet it is notorious, that <i>London</i> was the center,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1043" id="Page_1043">[1043]</a></span>
the place to which the finger of God was
pointed.</p>

<p>And this leads us in the <i>third</i> place, to
consider the moral use and purpose of these
<i>magnalia naturæ</i>, and prodigies of the agency
of material causes. For nothing sure, but
an electrical shock, and that from a divine
hand, could have been so well adjusted, as
twice, nay four times, so sensibly to shake
every house in <i>London</i>, and not throw one
down. This duty we will endeavour to execute,
from the words of that great man, king
<i>David</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="PSALM_xviii_7" id="PSALM_xviii_7">PSALM xviii. 7.</a></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i>Then the earth shook, and trembled; the foundations
also of the hills moved, and were
shaken; because he was wroth.</i></p>


<p>This Psalm is a triumphal song, which
<i>David</i> deliver'd publickly before God,
in thankful remembrance of the great mercies
he had receiv'd; being firmly established on
his throne: and all his enemies, foreign or
domestick, subdued.</p>

<p>He does not attribute this happy situation of
his affairs to his own prudence and courage;
but, like a consummate politician, absolutely
to the mediation of the divine providence.
He draws up a most grand and magnificent
description of the advent of the deity, such as
words never before expressed. All the heathen
pictures of the appearance of their gods, are
cold and lame, compar'd to this; which is
deservedly so much admir'd by all criticks that
have any taste for religion, as well as language.</p>

<p>This verse, in our text, is the first movement
in the scene, which was to represent the
appearance of <i>Jehovah</i>, without whose interposition
<i>David</i> hoped for nothing fortunate.
After describing all the pomp of light, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">[1045]</a></span>
darkness, celestial; hailstones, thunder, lightning,
and the like instances of majesty and terror,
in the skies; he still keeps his eye on the
ground, and concludes with the earthquake,
where he began.</p>

<p><i>Then the channels of waters were seen; and
the foundations of the earth were discovered;
at thy rebuke, O Lord; at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils.</i></p>

<p>Our holy psalmist, at other times, has exhibited
the same images, in different coloring;
as a great master varies his works, to
strike out all the beauties.</p>

<p>Psal. lxviii. 7. <i>O God, when thou wentest
forth before thy people; when thou didst march
thro' the wilderness; the earth shook, the heavens
also dropped, at the presence of God.
Even Sinai itself was moved, at the presence
of God; the God of Israel.</i></p>

<p>By this he means, the giving the law.
<i>Exod.</i> xix. 8. <i>And mount Sinai was altogether
on a smoke; because the Lord descended
on it in fire: and the smoke ascended as the
smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount
quaked greatly.</i></p>

<p>Again, Psal. cxiv. when he is describing
the passage over the <i>Red-sea</i>, and that over <i>Jordan</i>;
he brings in the machinery of earthquakes,
to testify the divine presence.</p>

<p><i>When Israel went out of Egypt, and the
house of Jacob from among a strange people;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">[1046]</a></span>
the sea saw it and fled. Jordan was driven
back.</i></p>

<p><i>The mountains skipped like rams: and the
little hills like young sheep.</i></p>

<p>Then he asks the question, <i>What ailed thee,
O thou sea, that thou fleddest? and thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back?</i></p>

<p><i>Ye mountains that ye skipped like rams, and
ye little hills like young sheep?</i></p>

<p>He answers: <i>Tremble thou earth at the presence
of the Lord: at the presence of the God
of Jacob.</i></p>

<p>He fails not to attribute these marvellous
appearances, to their true cause. Tho' he
knew full well, that the God of nature administred
the ordinary course of the earth by
second causes; yet he could not be so blind
but to perceive, when the waves of the ocean
retreated; when the waters of <i>Jordan</i> divided;
when mount <i>Sinai</i> was all in fire,
smoke, lightning and thunder, with the trumpet
of God sounding, and the whole mountain
shaking: he could not but perceive the
presence of the author of nature, in these extraordinary
appearances.</p>

<p>But every where in sacred scripture earthquakes
are particularly singled out, above all
other natural <i>phænomena</i>, as having more of
the majesty and terrific pomp, to denote an
immediate operation of God's hand; to excite
our fear, and shew his anger, as in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[1047]</a></span>
text, <i>because he was wroth</i>. In imitation of
the sacred writers, the heathen poets, both
<i>greek</i> and <i>latin</i>, express the anger of their <i>Jupiter</i>
by an earthquake:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Terrificam capitis concussit terque quaterque</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cæsariem; cum qua terram, mare, sidera, movit.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="tdr">Ovid.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="p0">The moving meteors in the free air, lightning,
coruscations, fire-balls, tempests, thunders, or
the dreaded comets, tho' frightful enough;
yet people that do not think to any purpose,
hope, as they are at a distance, to escape their
effects. But when the terror comes home to
us, to our feet; when the earth moves on
which we stand; what heart is not moved?
When our houses <i>shake</i> over our ears, the
greatest courage is <i>shaken</i>.</p>

<p>It is true, an earthquake causes an universal
dread among all sorts of people; even the
philosopher immersed in speculation of second
causes, quakes; as well as the pious, whose
fear proceeds from solid piety: a due sense of
the <i>anger</i> of the almighty Being.</p>

<p>We saw how the late earthquakes affrighted
every one; but, as to the generality, it was
but for a moment. When they found themselves
safe, and alive; thoughtless they ran to
their business, or their diversion: and this not
only the first, but the second time. And I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1048" id="Page_1048">[1048]</a></span>
am apprehensive, were another, and another
to come, they would only be less regarded
than the preceding. As the <i>Israelites</i>, to
whom miracles became familiar; as the <i>Jews</i>,
in our Saviour's time, demanding of him to
show them a sign from heaven, in the midst
of the constant scene of miracles innumerable.</p>

<p>But 'tis my present business to call you to
a due and serious reflexion, on these extraordinary
events; by considering,</p>

<p>I. What the written word of God, the holy
scriptures, informs us, concerning the ultimate
purpose of earthquakes.</p>

<p>II. What we can learn from profane history.</p>

<p>III. To conclude with our text, that they
are strictly and properly divine judgments; <i>because
he was wroth</i>.</p>

<p>Ever since the earth began, earthquakes
have been look'd on as extraordinary appearances,
among the prodigies of nature, and
executioners of divine justice. In the case of
<i>Korah</i>, <i>the earth opened her mouth and swallowed
them up; and their houses, and all the
men that pertained unto them; and all their
goods</i>.</p>

<p>In the miraculous victory obtain'd by <i>Jonathan</i>,
and his armor-bearer, over the army of
the <i>Philistines</i>, I. <i>Sam.</i> xiv. There was a panic
terror infus'd into the <i>Philistines</i>, and an
<i>earthquake</i>: it is call'd <i>a very great trembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1049" id="Page_1049">[1049]</a></span>
of God</i>. What the heathen attributed to <i>Pan</i>,
an imaginary deity of their own making: the
<i>Hebrews</i> rightly refer'd to the true cause, the
first, and supreme.</p>

<p>In the new testament, at our Saviour's
death, there was a great earthquake, which
was altogether miraculous; as much as the
eclipse of the sun then. The elements might
well sympathize with the God of nature. <i>The
sun was darkened, the vail of the temple was
rent in twain; the earth did quake, the rocks
rent.</i></p>

<p>Again, at his resurrection, <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. 2.
<i>There was a great earthquake. The angel of
the Lord descended from heaven, and rolled
back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</i></p>

<p><i>And for fear of him the keepers did shake,
and became as dead men.</i></p>

<p><i>Matt.</i> xxvii. 54. <i>When the centurion, and
they that were with him, watching Jesus,
saw the earthquake, they feared greatly.</i> See
the consequence of it in one place; and thus
in another:</p>

<p><i>Acts</i> iv. 31. <i>The Apostles</i>, in the infant
church, <i>when praying, the place was shaken,
where they were assembled together: and they
were all filled with the Holy Ghost</i>. The heathen
centurion <i>feared</i> upon the earthquake:
The christians praying, were <i>filled with the
Holy Ghost</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">[1050]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Acts</i> xvi. 26. When <i>Paul</i> and <i>Silas</i> were
in prison. <i>At mid-night when they pray'd, and
sang hymns to God, suddenly there was a great
earthquake; so that the foundations of the
prison were shaken. And immediately all the
doors were opened, and every one's bands were
loosed.</i></p>

<p>Observe the consequence it had upon the
gaoler; <i>He called for a light, and sprang in,
and came trembling, and fell down before
Paul and Silas, and said, Sirs, what must I
do to be saved?</i></p>

<p>The gaol trembled; and the gaoler trembled,
as is observed by a writer on this head,
an earthquake could <i>soften</i> his <i>hard</i> heart,
and <i>open</i> what he had <i>lock'd</i>. It awaken'd
him out of his spiritual slumber, as well as
his natural sleep, and made his conscience, as
well as the foundations of the prison, to
quake. A bad conscience is <i>as a troubled sea,
that cannot rest, but casteth up mire, and clay</i>.
The gaoler perceiv'd the celestial warning,
and made a proper use of it.</p>

<p>There are many circumstances in the nature
of earthquakes, which render them peculiarly
proper to be the instruments in God's
hand, to give warning to a people, to amend
their ways.</p>

<p>The <i>suddenness</i> is one. We saw, not long
ago, what an effect was produced by a solar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1051" id="Page_1051">[1051]</a></span>
eclipse, tho' it was expected long before. We
had the prediction, and calculations about it
in all our almanacs; yet there was an universal
seriousness that followed it. All that morning,
we could walk the street, without hearing
an oath, and the churches were full, in
time of prayer. But the <i>suddenness</i> of an
earthquake that comes at an instant, unthought
of, without warning, that seems to bring unavoidable
death along with it; is able to touch
an adamantin heart. To see death stalking
o'er a great city, ready to sweep us all away,
in an instantaneous ruin, without a single moment
to recollect our thoughts; this is fear
without remedy; this is far beyond battle and
pestilence. The lightning and thunderbolt,
<i>the arrow that flieth by day</i>, may suddenly
take off an object or two, and leave no space
for repentance: but what horror can equal
that, when above a million of people are liable
to be buried, in one common grave!</p>

<p>Another consideration that inhances the
dread of earthquakes, is the <i>unavoidableness</i>
of the calamity. Famine, and war, and rebellion,
and pestilence we may run from, the
disease among the cattle, and locusts, and the
like stripes of angry heaven, we may have
some chance to escape: but no means, no
precaution, no remedy, no prudence can screen
us, from so universal a desolation as this: 'tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">[1052]</a></span>
as the presence of God. Whither then can
we go to hide ourselves? Must we call upon
the rocks and mountains, to cover, and shelter
us from the divine wrath! <i>And they shall
go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
of the earth, for fear of the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, <i>and
for the glory of his majesty; when he ariseth
to shake terribly the earth</i>. Alas, those are the
very instruments he employs for our destruction;
to be our tombstones!</p>

<p>This <i>unusual</i> kind of death too, strikes us
with horror; to be buried alive. The earth,
the common mother of us all, and the common
grave; to eat up her offspring alive;
crouds all the images of amazement together,
that can enter into the heart of man.</p>

<p>The greater the terror accompanying earthquakes,
the greater a blessing is our deliverance
from the danger of it! What can equal
God's power and judgment but his mercy?
Consider the wonderful consequence; that the
whole city of <i>London</i> should so sensibly be
shaken, and yet no one inhabited house to
fall; nor one person kill'd. Amazing instance
of power, and goodness, in our preservation!
And this not only once, but the second time
also; tho' evidently stronger was the concussion.
So strong that almost every person was
throughly persuaded, that some part, at least,
of their houses, was falling down. Can we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1053" id="Page_1053">[1053]</a></span>
help admiring, that judgment should be so
temper'd with mercy! Do we look only at the
second causes with our unbelievers; and sport
away the divine presence, as if it was an ordinary
occurrence of every day? They want
to see a miracle. Nought can affect them,
but a direct, supernatural agency.</p>

<p>I answer, behold a visible, and notorious
miracle; plainly obvious, and before all their
senses. For can there be a greater miracle,
can any thing be more directly the finger of
God than this, which we ourselves saw with
our eyes; that befell the whole city of
<i>London</i>.</p>

<p>We know the nature of the building of
<i>London</i> houses; which sometimes fall of themselves,
without shaking. Wonderful then is
it to be thought, and a miracle indeed, that
every house in this vast city, should twice be
agitated, and rocked to and fro; and not one
fall, nor one person receive any damage.</p>

<p>In vain will the philosophers seek for a solution
of this problem, in natural causes only.
By their chymical experiments, they make some
little mimic imitations of tremors and fumes,
and explosions. So by gun-powder, we ape
the regal voice of thunder. But where is the
discretionary act of mercy, and benignity,
that separates between the vengeful and kind?
These second causes act according to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">[1054]</a></span>
material nature, like the roaring waves of the
ocean, that flow in, and overwhelm every
thing, where a breach is made. They can
observe no distinction between the lands of a
righteous man, and of a sinner: they cannot
stop at the breach, and gather themselves on
an heap, and not enter in at all, as the waters
of <i>Jordan</i> did.</p>

<p>But in the case before us, the hand of the
Lord, that stayed the flowing of the waters,
that quelled the raging of the sea, and its
proud waves; sets bounds to the trembling of
the earth. Hither shall its vibrations go, and
no further. When alas, if it went but one
inch further (in comparison) a total ruin must
unavoidably follow.</p>

<p>Consider this particular, when apply'd to
all the buildings in this immense city: and
wonder and adore, that almighty providence,
which overlook'd us, and prescrib'd the limits;
so narrow, so precise; which sav'd us
from universal havoc!</p>

<p>II. Did we escape; how much happier are
we, than the millions that have perished by
the like calamity? <i>Josephus</i> the famous <i>Jewish</i>
historian records, that about 29 years before
our Saviour's birth, there happened such an
earthquake in the country of <i>Judea</i>, that
30,000 men perished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1055" id="Page_1055">[1055]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fifth year of the reign of <i>Tiberius</i>,
so dreadful an earthquake happened in <i>Asia
minor</i>, that no less than 13 cities were destroy'd
in one night; many of them great,
and Royal: <i>Sardis</i> in particular, said to be second
to <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>A. D.</i> 66. Another earthquake happen'd
there, which destroy'd <i>Laodicea</i>, <i>Hierapolis</i>,
and <i>Colossus</i>.</p>

<p><i>A. D.</i> 79. Three cities in <i>Cyprus</i> were
overthrown.</p>

<p><i>A. D.</i> 114. The city of <i>Antioch</i> suffered
extremely; whilst the emperor <i>Trajan</i> was
in it. And in the 7th year of that emperor,
nine several cities were destroy'd in <i>Asia</i>,
<i>Greece</i>, and <i>Calabria</i>.</p>

<p>To come nearer home, and our own times:
In 1169, <i>Catania</i> in <i>Sicily</i> was destroyed, and
15,000 people killed.</p>

<p>1692, The whole city destroy'd and 18000
Inhabitants.</p>

<p>1456, At <i>Naples</i> 40,000 perished by an
earthquake.</p>

<p>1531, In the city of <i>Lisbon</i>, 1400 houses
were overthrown there, besides many damaged.</p>

<p>We know the miserable and deplorable
catastrophe of <i>Port-Royal</i>, in <i>Jamaica</i>; which
fell out in our own days. My blood shudders
at the relation of it. And not many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1056" id="Page_1056">[1056]</a></span>
months ago, the populous <i>Lima</i> in <i>America</i>,
was wholly swallowed up.</p>

<p>Have we not reason then to fear, for ourselves?
'Tis true, we have hitherto escaped.
But can we tell how soon God shall let loose
the avenging power of another; which may
come, for ought we know, while we are
speaking of it. And if it must come, happy
may it be for us, that it finds us in this place,
and so doing.</p>

<p>III. And this brings us, to consider the
uses of these admonitions; and to show, that
they are the effects of the divine anger. <i>For
the earth shook and trembled</i>, says the holy
psalmist, <i>the foundation of the hills moved
and were shaken; because he was wroth</i>.</p>

<p>And here we cannot possibly have a stronger
and more convincing evidence, of these
convulsions of nature, being the immediate
finger of God, than this single consideration.
Let us but reflect on what has been
said, in short; that these visitations only happen
to great and populous cities, to great and
eminent ports, and maritime <i>emporiums</i> flourishing
in trade, riches, and luxury.</p>

<p>We hear not of barren desarts, uninhabited
wildernesses, wide heaths, and downs,
rocky cliffs, and beaches of the sea, to be
the usual subject of earthquakes: but of towns
and cities. Not so much of little villages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1057" id="Page_1057">[1057]</a></span>
but of those immense collections of people.
God does not give his warnings to birds, and
beasts of the forest; to flocks of sheep; that
punctually execute the respective offices he
has enjoined them: but to us, the lords of
the creation; to whom he has given reason,
sense, and faculties, to reflect, and judge of
things, of our own actions, as well as his;
of <i>his</i> doings, toward the children of men.</p>

<p>We observed before, a plain and notorious
proof of God's hand in these judgments;
that he cou'd move a whole city without
throwing down a house. And this is most
assuredly a second proof; that he visits <i>only</i>
great cities, with these judgments. And we
must conclude this to be as strong an argument
of a divine interposition in these affairs,
as any mathematical demonstration.</p>

<p>Some free-thinkers, or free-livers, when
they find, they cannot set aside this reasoning,
shelter themselves, with the history of
God's converse with <i>Abraham</i>; about the
cities of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrha</i>; assuring themselves,
there is no danger. For tho' they
can't pretend to be the meritorious people;
yet they think God's mercy will be as signal
to us, as heretofore: and that we have
among us, at least ten righteous persons, to
save the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1058" id="Page_1058">[1058]</a></span></p>

<p>But vain are such hopes: God will say to
them, as heretofore to the <i>Jews</i>: <i>If I bring
my great judgments upon the earth, as I live
saith the Lord, tho'</i> Noah, Daniel, <i>and</i> Job
<i>were there; they should save neither sons, nor
daughters, but their own souls only</i>.</p>

<p>God can, if he pleases, by very extraordinary
means, preserve such as he thinks fit.
But in general judgments, the righteous must
undergo one common fate, with the wicked.
God's mercy will be shown to them after this
life, to make the superabundant amends.</p>

<p>But this is a solid lesson to us, of the necessity
of a future life. We may as well banish
God out of the earth, as to deny his attributes
of power, and goodness, and justice,
and the like. And these will insure us of a
future state; when an exact return will be
made, for our behaviour in this; otherwise
we might justly expostulate, as <i>Abraham</i>
did, <i>Will not the judge of all the earth do
right?</i></p>

<p>Good men, who have endeavour'd to do
their duty, may say, <i>God is our refuge and
strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be
remov'd; tho' the mountains be carried into the
midst of the sea; tho' the waters thereof roar,
and be troubled; tho' the mountains shake with
the swelling thereof.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1059" id="Page_1059">[1059]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Come behold the works of the Lord; what
desolations he hath made on the earth.</i></p>

<p>In the mean time, let us not think on
running <i>away</i> from the danger, so much as
on mending our <i>ways</i>; perfecting the christian
life; reforming the abominable crimes,
so justly chargeable on great and maritime
cities; overflowing with riches, pride, and
luxury, with vanity, pleasure, and profaneness;
with gaming, immorality, infidelity;
and especially with the notorious crime of
sabbath-breaking, which is the foundation of
all, and comprehends all others; for it prevents
people from amending of any. If they
fail of their duty towards God, in making
their regular approaches to his temple; no
wonder they are guilty of all crimes; regard
neither God nor man. If they fail of coming,
where they may hope for the kindly influences
of God's holy Spirit; we need not
wonder at their egregious wickedness: they
become absolutely irreclaimable.</p>

<p>But of you, my beloved brethren, here assembled,
I hope better things. You shun the
degenerate corruptions of this evil age; you
are not of the number of those that frequent
our public meetings of folly, from the morning
rendezvouzes to the mid-night assemblies;
and <i>that</i> protracted to the morning
light again. As if we ought to banish all serious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1060" id="Page_1060">[1060]</a></span>
thoughts of our immortal interests; and
<i>that</i> in the sacred season of lent; destin'd by
the church, for this very serious purpose.</p>

<p>Let us think, how this warning happen'd
to us, in the time of lent; when they were
revelling in their places of entertainment,
both morning and evening, as if no such
thing had been; and this on the very days;
as if they confronted, and dar'd almighty vengeance.
Much of a parallel case with that
of the famous city of <i>Herculaneum</i>, which is
now the entertainment of the curious. First
it was miserably shatter'd by an earthquake;
whilst the people were at their diversions in
the theatre; where all assembled perished.
This was in the first year of <i>Titus</i> the emperor:
but such a partial judgment not
mending their manners; 9 years after, the
whole city was destroy'd by a lake of liquid
fire and brimstone, from mount <i>Vesuvius</i>,
just in the manner we now find it; 50 foot
deep in cinders, and ashes.</p>

<p><i>When thy judgments, O God, are abroad,
the inhabitants of the earth will learn righteousness.</i></p>

<p><i>The Lord is the true God; he is the living
God; the everlasting King: At his wrath,
the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall
not be able to abide his indignation</i>; says the
prophet <i>Jeremiah</i>, x. 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1061" id="Page_1061">[1061]</a></span></p>

<p>God give us grace, that instead of these
short-liv'd, and unsatisfying pleasures; instead
of palaces and houses here, ornamented
in a sumptuous and elegant <i>taste</i>; which
may perhaps be swept away, with their
owners, in a moment; we may aspire towards
that heavenly city, which is above;
whose foundations are not laid with hands,
eternal in the heavens, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE2" id="PREFACE2">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p><i>This discourse is but a necessary consequence
of the preceding. The whole
no other than an essay, toward investigating
the true nature of the wonderful appearance
of an earthquake. And something is done toward
it, if only by eradicating an old error.
In attaining the proposed end, I
have endeavour'd to lay all the necessary circumstances
together, which to our great amazement
we have seen, and felt. That they may
not be as soon forgotten, as they generally were,
by the giddy multitude; equally thoughtless of
what they knew to be past, as childishly fearful
of an imaginary one, subsequent: for which
there could not be the least ground of apprehension.
By sober persons it was, with great
reason, thought a judicial infatuation, and as
much to be wonder'd at, as an earthquake itself;
a real panic. When a third part of
this immense city ran out into the fields for
half a cold night; alarm'd with the silly prediction
of a distemper'd fellow!</i></p>

<p><i>Nothing could tempt one to commemorate
the follies of our cotemporaries, but the hope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2004" id="Page_2004">[2004]</a></span>
it may be useful hereafter: and to show the
true cause of this senseless terror; the want of
a true sense of religion; and an universal degeneracy,
and corruption of manners: begun
by the great ones, and now propagated thro'
all degrees to the lowest: begun in this great
city; and now advancing apace to every great
town in the kingdom.</i></p>

<p><i>'Tis from the great ones alone, that we can
hope for a reformation: and</i> that <i>by a strict
observance of the sabbatical duty. Example,
we know, governs the actions of mankind</i>.
That <i>must restore the practice, and the influence
of religion: which alone can prevent the
dangers that infest every corner of our streets;
every road in the kingdom. We mistake the point,
and betray our ignorance in human nature,
when we think, acts of parliament, laws,
and executions will do it. They are very
weak in comparison of the impressions of religion,
and conscience: as all philosophy both
natural and religious, has hitherto thought,
and known.</i></p>

<i>Martin Folkes</i>, Esq; LL. D.<br />

<span class="smaller">President of the Royal Society.</span></h2>


<p>Since I had the honour to lay before
the Society, in the spring, my thoughts
upon earthquakes: we have had many
further opportunities of reflecting upon
that most awful, and hitherto unusual appearance.
An earthquake was felt at <i>Eastwell</i>
in <i>Kent</i>, on <i>monday march</i> 12, and on <i>sunday,
march</i> 18, at <i>Portsmouth</i>, the <i>Isle of Wight</i>,
<i>Southampton</i>, and along the coast of <i>Sussex</i>,
the isles of <i>Guernsey</i>, <i>Jersey</i>. <i>April</i> 2, a
smart earthquake at <i>Manchester</i>, <i>Liverpool</i>,
<i>Taunton</i>, <i>Bath</i>, <i>Flint</i>, <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>Wrexham</i>,
reaching 40 miles north and south: 70
miles east and west. Since then at <i>Rome</i>,
<i>Naples</i>, <i>Leghorn</i>; in the south of <i>France</i>,
and at <i>Pau</i> under the <i>Pyrenean</i> mountains:
<i>Oporto</i>, at <i>S. Macaire</i> in <i>Guienne</i>, <i>Messina</i> in
<i>Sicily</i>, <i>Munich</i> in <i>Bavaria</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. so that
the year 1750, may rather be called the year
of earthquakes, than of jubilee. For since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2006" id="Page_2006">[2006]</a></span>
<i>February</i> last, when they began with us at
<i>London</i>; as far as I can learn, they have appear'd
in many parts of <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i>,
and <i>America</i>. And have likewise revisited
many counties in our own island, and at
length, on the 30th of last <i>september</i> gave
much the most extensive shock, we have seen
here in our days.</p>

<p>It may be well expected, that these frequent
visits, in themselves so very extraordinary,
to us so rare, and <i>that</i> in one year,
should keep up our attention: and as to my
own part, induce one to reflect, on what I
before offer'd concerning them; and be a sufficient
apology for the present paper.</p>

<p>We have been acquainted, by those who
remember it, that in the earthquake of nov.
1703, which happen'd in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, the
weather was calm, close, gloomy, warm, and
dry; in a degree highly unusual, at that season.
And thus it has been with us, all the
year. And from the numerous accounts we
have receiv'd at the Royal Society, in the beginning,
and ending of the year; where any
mention is made of the weather; they all
agree in the like particular. Which is consentaneous
to what I remark'd, as the constant
forerunner of earthquakes; and what prepares
the earth's surface, for the electrical
stroke: which I asserted to be the cause of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2007" id="Page_2007">[2007]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>may</i> last, we had a paper read at the
Royal Society, concerning the second earthquake
felt by us at <i>London</i>, on the 8th of <i>march</i>.
A shepherd belonging to Mr. Secretary <i>Fox</i>
at <i>Kensington</i> (the sky being perfectly serene,
and clear) was much surprised with a very
extraordinary noise in the air, rolling over his
head, as of cannon close by. He likewise
thought, that it came from the north-west,
and went to the south-east: a motion quite
contrary, to what must have been the case,
if it were really of cannon. This noise pass'd
rushing by him; and instantly he saw the
ground (a dry, and solid spot) wave under
him, like the face of the river. The tall
trees of the avenue, where he was, nodded
their tops very sensibly, and quiver'd like a
shaken spear. The flock of sheep immediately
took fright, and ran all away together, as
if dogs had pursued them. A great rookery
in the place, were equally alarm'd, and after
an universal clangor, flew away; no less than
if chaced by hawks.</p>

<p>I was likewise inform'd, that in the same
earthquake, a great parcel of hens, and chickens,
kept at that time in <i>Gray's-inn-lane</i>, upon
the shock, ran to the roost, affrighted.
And the like was observ'd of pigeons. And
in our last account of the earthquake from
<i>Northampton</i>, 'tis remarked, that the birds in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2008" id="Page_2008">[2008]</a></span>
cages put their heads under their wings, as to
hide themselves.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 21, at the Royal Society, Mr. <i>Jackson</i>
potter at <i>Lambeth</i>, gave an account of
some boats, cobles and lighters in the river, at
that time; the people in them seem'd to feel,
as if a porpoise, or some great fish had
heav'd and thump'd at the bottom of the
vessels. This is sometimes the case of ships
at sea, when all is perfectly calm: which
seems evidently owing to an electrical impression
on the water.</p>

<p>In the evening-post of <i>june</i> 23, we had
a paragraph from <i>Venice</i>, that a terrible earthquake
had been felt lately in the little rocky
isle of <i>Cerigo</i>, in the <i>Mediterranean</i>, south
of <i>Morea</i>. It threw down a great number
of houses; and above 2000 of the inhabitants
were buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>Another earthquake about that time, happen'd
in <i>Switzerland</i>; which split a vast,
rocky mountain; and an old castle wall of an
immense thickness.</p>

<p>All these circumstances, and many more
confirmed me in my former opinion. But
since then, these wonderful movements have
stalk'd round the globe: and again been lately
felt in our own island; happily for us, to
the terror only, of many thousand people:
beside those concussions of this sort that appear'd
in the western parts, in the more early
time of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2009" id="Page_2009">[2009]</a></span></p>

<p>I receiv'd a letter from my friend <i>Maurice
Johnson</i>, Esq; the founder, and secretary of
the Literary Society of <i>Spalding</i>; which has
now subsisted these 40 years. He acquaints
me, that on <i>thursday</i>, 23d of <i>August</i> last, an
earthquake was very sensibly felt there, about
seven o'clock in the morning; throughout the
whole town and neighbourhood; and many
miles round: but that it chiefly spread itself
northward, and southward. He says, that
for a fortnight before, the weather had been
serene, mild, and calm. And one evening,
there was a deep red <i>aurora australis</i>, covering
the cope of heaven, very terrible to behold.
This same shock was felt at <i>Grantham</i>,
<i>Stamford</i>, and <i>Milton</i> by <i>Peterborough</i>;
and generally at all the intermediate places:
and from <i>Spalding</i> it fled northward, along
the sea shore, to <i>Boston</i>: thence up <i>Boston</i>
river, to <i>Lincoln</i>.</p>

<p>Since then, I had a letter from Mr. Alderman
<i>Taylor</i> of <i>Stamford</i>, giving an account of
another earthquake, that happen'd there, <i>september</i>
30, at 36 minutes after twelve o'clock
at noon. He describes it thus. They were suddenly
surprised with an uncommon noise in
the air, like the rolling of large carriages in
the streets, for about 20 seconds. At the same
instant they felt a great shake, or snap, as he
calls it; insomuch that it sensibly shook a
punch-bowl, which was in his parlour, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2010" id="Page_2010">[2010]</a></span>
made it ring. He says, it was perceiv'd of
most of the people of <i>Stamford</i>, who generally
ran out of their houses. At <i>Oakham</i> the
chief town of <i>Rutland</i>, the congregation ran
out of the church whilst the preacher was in
the pulpit. All the towns round <i>Stamford</i>,
were sensible of it: and at <i>Peterborough</i>, down
to <i>Wisbech</i>.</p>

<p>Thus far the Alderman. But we have had
many advices from all hands, at the first, and
second meetings of the Royal Society, for the
winter season; with further particulars relating
to this great concussion. That it was
felt at the same time, at <i>Rugby</i> in <i>Warwickshire</i>,
and reach'd to <i>Warwick</i>, at <i>Lutterworth</i>,
in <i>Leicestershire</i>: at <i>Leicester</i>, and
round about. It extended itself to <i>Coventry</i>,
<i>Derby</i>, <i>Nottingham</i>, <i>Newark</i>; then came
eastward to <i>Harborough</i>, <i>Towcester</i>, <i>Northampton</i>,
<i>Rowel</i>, <i>Kettering</i>, <i>Wellingborough</i>, <i>Oundle</i>,
in <i>Northamptonshire</i>; <i>Uppingham</i>, <i>Oakham</i>
in <i>Rutland</i>; <i>Stamford</i>, <i>Bourn</i>, <i>Grantham</i>,
<i>Spalding</i>, <i>Boston</i>, and to <i>Lincoln</i> in <i>Lincolnshire</i>;
<i>Holbech</i>, and all <i>Holland</i> in that county.
<i>Peterborough</i>, <i>Wisbech</i>, in the isle of <i>Ely</i>;
together with all the intermediate, and adjacent
places. Then it passed over the whole
breadth of <i>Ely</i> fen: was felt at <i>Mildenhall</i>,
and reach'd to <i>Calford</i> by <i>Bury</i> in <i>Suffolk</i>, and
the country thereabouts; of which we had
notice from lady <i>Cornwallis</i>. An extent from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2011" id="Page_2011">[2011]</a></span>
<i>Warwick</i> to <i>Bury</i> of about 100 miles in
length; and generally speaking, 40 miles in
breadth. And this vast space was pervaded
by this amazing motion, as far as we can get
any satisfaction, in the same instant of time.
They describe it, that the houses totter'd, and
seem'd to heave up, and down: tho' it lasted
but a few seconds. It was attended with a rushing
noise, as if the houses were falling, and
people were universally so affrighted, as to
run out; imagining that their own, or their
neighbours houses were tumbling on their
heads. In the villages around, the people
being generally at divine service, were much
alarm'd: both with the noise, which exceeded
all the thunder they had ever heard, beyond
compare: and with the great shock accompanying;
which was like somewhat, as
they imagin'd, that rush'd against the church-walls,
and roof. Some thinking the pillars
crack'd, many that the beams of the roof
were disjointed; and all, that the whole was
falling. And happy were they that could get
out first. Many people fancied, that nests of
drawers, and cabinets, or the like heavy
things, were fallen down above stairs: or that
chimnies had broke thro' the roof of the
house: or that some persons fell down stairs:
and the like. Some perceived the crackling
of inward wainscots or partitions: as Dr. <i>Mortimer</i>
and I, observ'd in our first and second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2012" id="Page_2012">[2012]</a></span>
shocks at <i>London</i>. A few slates, tiles, and
parts of chimneys fell from some houses:
pewter, china, glasses and brass from shelves.
A clock bell, chamber bell sometime struck:
windows universally rattled, and the like circumstances
of tremor.</p>

<p>In regard to circumstances, they were pretty
similar throughout. Many people sitting in
their chairs relate, that they and their chairs
were several times sensibly lifted up and set
down again. A stack of chimneys were
thrown down in <i>College-lane</i>; a place retaining
the memory of a sort of university
once beginning at <i>Northampton</i>. The windows
of houses rattled throughout the whole town:
but no mischief done: in general it was frightful,
and innocuous.</p>

<p>They fancied there, the motion of it, as
they expressed it, to be eastward. In streets
that run north and south, the houses on the
east side of the way, were most affected. And
Dr. <i>Stonehouse</i>'s dwelling, the strongest in the
town, was most sensibly shaken. So it was likewise
observ'd, that churches were most subject
to its violence. They thought too, that
the motion seem'd rather horizontal, or lateral,
than upward. Some counted the pulses
distinctly, to the number of four: that the
second, and third pulses were stronger, than
the first, and fourth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2013" id="Page_2013">[2013]</a></span></p>

<p>From all these various accounts, there was
no sulphureous smell, or eruption; no fissures
in the ground perceived. Yet several people
were sick upon it: infinite numbers terribly
affrighted, and as soon forgot the impression
of it; or talk'd of it in a merry strain; as
commonly with us at <i>London</i>. So little are
the vulgar assessed, without something very
sensible; and so soon is the sense of it worn
out!</p>

<p>It was more evidently perceiv'd, by people
standing; most, by those that were sitting:
least, by such as were walking: and in upper
stories of houses, more than in lower; or in
cellars. Some coming down stairs, were in
danger of being thrown forwards. Several
sitting in a chair, and hearing the hollow,
thundering noise, and thinking it was a
coach passing by; when they attempted to
get up, to see what it was, they were thrown
back again in their chair. Some heard the
wainscot crackle, Some sitting in their chairs
leaning forwards, were thrown down on their
hands, and knees. Some people heard the
noise without feeling the shock: others felt
the shock without hearing the noise. Some
in a standing posture, were forc'd to lay hold
on a table, to keep themselves from falling.</p>

<p>It was particularly remarked (as before observ'd)
that birds in cages were sensibly affrighted;
thrusting their heads under their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2014" id="Page_2014">[2014]</a></span>
wings. Mrs. <i>Allicock</i> of <i>Loddington</i>, <i>Northamptonshire</i>,
a lady in child-bed, was so affected,
that it caused her death. Mrs. <i>Hardy</i>,
another lady in the same circumstance, and in
the same county, likewise expired upon it,
Some people felt a sudden shortness of breath,
that they were forc'd to go out into the open
air, it so affected the pulmonary nerves.
Many were taken with head-achs, and other
sicknesses.</p>

<p>These are, in general, the circumstances
and observations made, at the time of these
earthquakes; when we recollect ourselves,
after the suddeness, and fright. Give me
leave to make the following remarks therefrom.</p>

<p>1st. As far as we can possibly learn, where
no one can be prepar'd, at different places, by
time keepers; this mighty concussion was felt
precisely at the same instant of time; being
about half an hour after twelve at noon. This,
I presume, cannot be accounted for, by any
natural power, but by that of an electrical
vibration; which, we know, acts instantaneously.</p>

<p>2dly, Let us reflect on the vast extent of
this trembling, 100 miles in length, 40 in
breadth, which amounts to 4000 square miles
in surface. That this should be put into such
an agitation, in one moment of time, is such
a prodigy; as we should never believe, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2015" id="Page_2015">[2015]</a></span>
conceive, did we not know it to be fact, from
our own senses. But if we look for a solution
of it, we cannot think, any natural
power is equal to it, but that of electricity;
which acknowledges no sensible transition of
time; no bounds.</p>

<p>3ly, We observe, the vulgar solution of subterraneous
eruptions receives no countenance,
from all that was seen, or felt, during these
earthquakes. It would be very hard to imagine,
how any such thing could so suddenly,
and instantaneously operate, thro' this vast
space: and <i>that</i> in so similar, and tender a
manner over the whole, thro' so great a variety,
as well as extent of country; as to do
no mischief. A philosophical inquirer in
<i>Northamptonshire</i> had his eye particularly
on this point, takes notice, there were not any
fissures in the ground; any sulphureous smells,
or eruptions any where perceiv'd; so as to favour
internal convulsions of the earth. The
reverend Mr. <i>Nixon</i> of <i>Higham</i>, and Mr.
<i>Smith</i>, in his letter from <i>Peterborough</i> take
notice, that they could not learn, there were
any sort of eruptions out of the earth, any
where: no smoke, vapor, or smell: tho'
they made sufficient inquiry about that circumstance,
according to particular direction.
Yet we learn from a letter at <i>Uppingham</i> in
<i>Rutland</i>, that a plaister floor became crack'd
thereby. These kind of floors are frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2016" id="Page_2016">[2016]</a></span>
in this country; what we call <i>stucco</i> in <i>London</i>:
and it gives us a good notion of the undulatory
vibration, produc'd by an earthquake;
which some have compar'd to that
of a musical string: others to that of a dog,
or a horse shaking themselves, when they
come out of the water. This last comparison
would have pleased some of the ancients,
who would needs fancy, that the globe of the
earth was a great animal. <i>Plato</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>,
and others, had such kind of sentiments.
Whence one may imagine, that they would
conceive an earthquake to be, as when a
horse shakes a part of his skin, upon a fly
touching him. Some of our correspondents
express the motion of an earthquake to be
like a boat lifted up by one wave, let down
by another.</p>

<p>4ly, The former earthquake that happen'd
at <i>Grantham</i>, <i>Spalding</i>, <i>Stamford</i>, (which
towns lie in a triangle) took up a space which
may, in gross, be accounted a circle of 30
miles diameter: the center of which is that
great morass, called <i>Deeping-fen</i>. This comprehends
15 miles of that 30, in diameter:
and where probably, the electrical impression
was first made. Much the major part of
<i>Deeping-fen</i> is under water in the winter
time; underneath 'tis a perfect bog. Now
it is very obvious, how little favorable such
ground is, for subterraneous fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2017" id="Page_2017">[2017]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second earthquake, not only this
country was affected again, but likewise a
much larger space of the same sort of fenny
ground, rather worse than the former: all
<i>Donnington-fen</i>, <i>Deeping-fen</i>, <i>Croyland-fen</i>,
<i>Thorney-fen</i>, <i>Whitlesea-fen</i>, <i>Bedford</i> level,
and the whole extent of <i>Ely-fen</i>, under various
denominations. This country, under
the turf, abounds with subterraneous timber
of all sorts; fir, oak, and brush-wood: and
stags horns. Now and then they find a quantity
of hazel nuts, crouded together on an
heap. I have some of them. This is a matter
common to all boggy ground over the
whole globe, Such things are the ruins of
the <i>antediluvian</i> world, washed down from
the high country where they grew, were here
lodg'd upon the subsiding of the waters, and by
time are o'ergrown with the present turf. They
that seek for any other solution of this affair,
than the universal <i>Noachian</i> deluge, want to
account for a general effect, by a partial cause:
and shut their eyes, both to the plain history
of this matter; and to the infinite, notorious
demonstrations of it, from fossil appearances.</p>

<p>5ly, All this country, tho' underneath 'tis a
watry bog, yet thro' this whole summer, and
autumnal season (as they can have no natural
springs in such a level) the drought has been
so great on the superficies, that the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2018" id="Page_2018">[2018]</a></span>
were oblig'd every day, to drive their
cattle several miles, for watering. The drought
was greater, than has been known in the memory
of any one living. This shows how
fit the dry surface was, for an electrical vibration.
And we learn from hence, this important
particular, that it reaches but very little
below the earth's surface.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, in another letter which he
wrote to me concerning the second earthquake
observ'd at <i>Spalding</i>; says upon this occasion,
he was obliged to scour his canal, and deepen
it: that they came to a white, quicksand;
which afforded to all the neighbourhood, excellent
water in plenty.</p>

<p>In the gravelly soil of <i>London</i>; and where
the two shocks were felt by us, in the beginning
of the year; we know, there is not a
house in the whole extent of this vast city,
and all around it, but a spring of water is
ready, upon digging a well, Whence we
have much reason to believe, that the interior
of the earth, is like a sponge soak'd in water.
So that the only dry part is the superficies,
which is the object, and the subject
of that electric vibration; wherein, according
to my sentiments, an earthquake consists.</p>

<p>This shews the mistake of the ancients,
who fancying that earthquakes proceeded from
subterraneous eruptions, built their prodigious
temple of <i>Diana</i> at <i>Ephesus</i>, upon a boggy

ground, to prevent such a disaster, The
marshy part of <i>Lincolnshire</i>, being my native
country, the adjacent fen, together with that
in the isle of <i>Ely</i>, I have been perfectly acquainted
with; from one end to the other,
ever since I knew any thing. This vast extent
of fenny level, from near <i>Cambridge</i> in the
south, to near <i>Horncastle</i> in the north, is 70
miles in length. And when I perceiv'd, that
it was, in whole, or in part, shaken by both
the last earthquakes: I could not but see, that
it was no less than a demonstration against the
old notion of their cause.</p>

<p>6ly, Earthquakes are truly most violent, in a
rocky country: because the shock is proportionate
to the solidity of the matter electrify'd.
So that rocks, cliffs, quarries, old castle
walls, and strong buildings, are most obnoxious
to the concussion. The isle of <i>Cerigo</i>
was more liable, and more rudely handled by
the late earthquake; both because it was an
isle, and because it was rocky. So we must
say of the late earthquake in <i>Switzerland</i>, that
split the mountain, and the old castle wall.
Whence Mr. <i>Johnson</i> in his second letter, says,
it cracked a very strong brick-house in <i>Gosberton</i>
by <i>Spalding</i>. Dr. <i>Doderidge</i> observes
from <i>Northampton</i> that Dr. <i>Stonehouse</i>'s dwelling
being a very strong one, was most sensibly
shaken. And throughout the whole compass
of this great earthquake, we find, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2020" id="Page_2020">[2020]</a></span>
the noise, the shock, and the terror was greatest
at the churches, whose walls and bulk made
more resistance than houses. And generally
speaking, the churches throughout this whole
extent have very fair, and large towers, and
very many remarkable spires all of good stone,
which no doubt quiver'd very much at top,
if we could have discern'd it. This same vibration
impressed on the water, meeting with
the solid of the bottom of ships, and lighters,
gives that thump felt thereon; just as in common
electrifying, we feel the stroke upon the
joints of our limbs chiefly. Yet of the millions
of ordinary houses, over which it passed,
not one fell. A consideration which sufficiently
points out to us, what sort of a motion this
was not, what sort of a motion it was, and
whence deriv'd; not a convulsion of the bowels
of the earth, but an uniform vibration or undulation
of its surface, aptly thought like that
of a musical string: or what we put a drinking
glass into, by rubbing one's finger over
the edge; which yet brought to a certain pitch,
breaks the glass; undoubtedly an electric repulsion
of parts. And from this remarkable
similarity in the appearance of earthquakes we
gather an invincible argument against the old
opinion of their cause; for the tumult of subterraneous
eruptions can have no possible place
herein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2021" id="Page_2021">[2021]</a></span></p>

<p>7ly, We find from all accounts, ancient and
modern, that the weather preceding these
shocks, was mild, warm, dry, serene, clear,
frosty: what notoriously favours all our electrical
experiments. This is particularly observ'd
by Mr. <i>Johnson</i> and Mr. <i>Smith</i>, and other
accounts. In the extensive shock of <i>sunday
march</i> 18, along the <i>Sussex</i> coast, they
take notice from <i>Portsmouth</i>, that the day was
serene, warm, and dry, and that a shower of
rain fell immediately before the shock. Mr.
<i>Bowman</i> of <i>Moulsey</i> observ'd a shock there on
<i>may</i> 24 last, and says, the air was perfectly
serene, and clear. We very well know, that
generally, all last winter spring, summer, and
autumn, have been most remarkably of this
kind of weather; more so, than has been observ'd
in our memory; and have had all those
requisites, appearances, and preparations, that
notoriously cause electricity, that promote it, or
that are the effects of it.</p>

<p>8ly, We find the blood-red <i>australis aurora</i>
preceding at <i>Spalding</i>, as with us at <i>London</i>.
At the time of the earthquake at <i>Manchester</i>
this year, it accompanied it. And this year
has been more remarkable than any for fire-balls,
storms, wind, thunder, lightnings, and
coruscations, almost throughout all <i>England</i>.
A large ball of fire, with a long fiery tail on
<i>july</i> 22, that passed over great part of <i>England</i>
northward. Another seen over <i>London</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2022" id="Page_2022">[2022]</a></span>
passing from west to east, in <i>october</i>. Coruscations
were seen just before that extensive
shock of 70 miles long felt from <i>Lancaster</i> to
<i>Wrexham</i>, on <i>april</i> 2, last. Fire-balls more
than one were seen in <i>Rutland</i>, and <i>Lincolnshire</i>:
and particularly observ'd. And Mr.
<i>Smith</i> from <i>Peterborough</i> writes, that a fire-ball
was seen the morning of the earthquake,
in the upper part of <i>Northamptonshire</i>. All
these kind of meteors are rightly judg'd to
proceed from a state of electricity in the earth
and atmosphere: and how far they are actually
concerned in causing earthquakes, time,
and accurate observation must inform us.</p>

<p>9ly, Mr. <i>Johnson</i> in both his letters to me,
on the first and second earthquakes, at <i>Spalding</i>,
remarks particularly, of their effects being
mostly spread to the north and south, and
especially felt on the sea coast. We may observe,
that such is the direction of <i>Spalding</i>
river, which both conducts, and strengthens
the electric vibration: conveying it along the
sea-shore thence, up to <i>Boston</i> channel; and
so up <i>Boston</i> river to <i>Lincoln</i>, as we discern,
by casting our eye on a map.</p>

<p>We observe further, that the main of this
second earthquake display'd its effects along,
and between the two rivers, <i>Welland</i> and <i>Avon</i>:
and <i>that</i> from their very origins, down to their
fall into the sea. It likewise reach'd the river
<i>Witham</i>, which directed the electric stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2023" id="Page_2023">[2023]</a></span>
that way too, to <i>Lincoln</i>. For which reason,
as there meeting the same coming from <i>Boston</i>,
the shock was most sensibly felt. It
reach'd likewise to the <i>Trent</i> at <i>Nottingham</i>,
which convey'd it to <i>Newark</i>.</p>

<p>The first electrical stroke seems to have been
made on the high ground above <i>Daventry</i>, in
<i>Northamptonshire</i>; where the <i>Roman</i> camps
are, made by <i>P. Ostorius</i> the proprætor. From
thence it descended chiefly eastward, and along
the river <i>Welland</i>, from <i>Harborough</i> to <i>Stamford</i>,
<i>Spalding</i>, the sea: and along the river
<i>Avon</i>, or <i>Nen</i>, to <i>Northampton</i>, <i>Peterborough</i>,
<i>Wisbech</i> to the sea. It spread itself all over
the vast level of the isle of <i>Ely</i>; further'd by
very many canals, and rivers, natural, and artificial,
made for drainage. It was still conducted
eastward up <i>Mildenhall</i> river, in <i>Suffolk</i>, to
<i>Bury</i>, and the parts adjacent. All this affair
duly consider'd, is a confirmation of the doctrine
I advanc'd on this subject.</p>

<p>10ly, I apprehend, it was not the noise in
the air, as of many cannon let off at once, preceding
the earthquake, that so much affrighted
people, or affected the sheep, the rookery at
<i>Kensington</i>, the hen and chickens in <i>Gray's-inn-lane</i>,
the pigeons. It could not be barely
the superficial movement of the earth, that disturb'd
them all at once. I judge it to be the
<i>effect</i> of electricity, somewhat like what causes
sea sickness; such a sort of motion, as we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2024" id="Page_2024">[2024]</a></span>
not accustomed to. So the earthquake affects
all those of weak nerves, or that have nervous
complaints; obnoxious to hysterics, colics,
rheumatick pains in their joints; several women
were seized with violent head-achs, before
both the shocks we felt in <i>London</i>. It
was this that gave the people a shortness of
breath. Mr. <i>Smith</i> from <i>Peterborough</i> speaks
of a person that found himself very sick upon
it. This made the dog run whining about
the room, seeking to get out: this made the
fishes leap up in the pond at <i>Southwark</i>; like
as the experiment of electrifying the fishes:
it makes them sick. And this causes the birds
in cages to hide their heads under their wings,
because they cannot fly away. Which is commonly
observ'd of them in <i>Italy</i>, and countries,
where earthquakes are more frequent.</p>

<p>11ly, I observe, the shepherd at <i>Kensington</i>
thought the motion of the earthquake, and
the sound, was from the north-west to
south-east; the like Mr. <i>W. Smith</i> from
<i>Peterborough</i>. On the contrary, Mr. <i>Byfield</i>
the scarlet dyer in <i>Southwark</i>, thought the
noise came from the river below bridge, and
went toward <i>Westminster</i>; where it rattled so,
that he did not doubt, but that the abbey-church
was beaten down.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Parsons</i> took pains to find out the way of
the motion of the earthquake, from the different
position of people's beds; but from the contradictory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2025" id="Page_2025">[2025]</a></span>
answers given, he cou'd not obtain any
satisfaction, as to that point. All this, and what
was observ'd from <i>Northampton</i>, of the motion
being thought by some, to be upward and
downward; by others rather horizontal, or lateral:
the counting the pulses, and the like,
only points out to us the prodigious celerity,
and the vibratory species of the motion of an
earthquake. But far, very far is this from being
owing to the tumultuous ebullition, the irregular
hurry of subterraneous explosions.</p>

<p>12ly, How the atmosphere, and earth, are
put into that electric and vibratory state,
which prepares them to give, or receive the
snap, and the shock, which we call an earthquake;
what it is, that immediately produces
it, we cannot say: any more than we can define,
what is the cause of magnetism, or of
gravitation; or how muscular motion is perform'd,
or a thousand other secrets in nature.</p>

<p>We seem to know, that the author of the
world has disseminated ethereal fire, thro' all
matter, by which these great operations are
brought about. This is the subtil fluid of Sir
<i>Isaac Newton</i>, pervading all things: the occult
fire diffused thro' the universe, according to
<i>Marsilius Ficinus</i> the platonic philosopher, on
the <i>Timeus</i> of his master. All the Platonists
insist on an occult fire passing thro', and agitating
all substance, by its vigorous and expansive
motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2026" id="Page_2026">[2026]</a></span></p>

<p>Before them, <i>Hippocrates</i> writes in the same
sense, <i>I. de victûs ratione</i>, that this fire moves
all in all. This ethereal fire is one of the four
elements of the ancients. It lies latent, and
dispersed thro' all the other three, and quiescent:
till collected into a quantity, that over-balances
the circumjacent; like the air crouded
into a tempest: or till it is excited, by any
proper motion.</p>

<p>This fire gives elasticity: and elasticity or
vibration is the mother of electricity. We don't
so much wonder at phosphorus arising from
animal substances; for this fire is in water, and
betrays itself to our senses, in salt water. Many
a time when I have passed the <i>Lincolnshire</i>
washes, in the night time; the horse has seem'd
to tread in liquid flames. The same appearance
is oft at the keel of a ship. Fire exists in
water, says <i>Pliny</i>, as well as in human bodies.
<i>nat. hist.</i> II. 107. Loaf sugar beaten in the
dark is luminous. Many vegetables, as indian
cane, and rotten wood the like, as <i>Bartholin</i>
largely recites, <i>de luce hominum</i> c. 4. All electric
bodies have this privilege: that is, they
more easily discover it. Amber, gum lac,
naptha, bitumens, some precious stones. My
old friend Mr. <i>Stephen Gray</i> the father and
great propagator of electricity, show'd me experiments
therein, in the year 1705, then at
<i>Corpus Christi</i> college in <i>Cambridge</i>. Afterward
in the year 1719, he show'd by experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2027" id="Page_2027">[2027]</a></span>
before the Royal Society, that paper,
ribbands, silk, sattin, cloth, shavings, linen,
goldbeaters skin, and in short, almost all kind
of substances discover electrical sparks of fire
in the dark: especially when well warm'd before
the fire, or in a cold, dry, nitrous air, and
in a room where there is no company. This
same quality is found <i>in vacuo</i>, as Dr. <i>Desaguliers</i>
show'd before the Royal Society, <i>march</i>
31, 1720. He took an exhausted glass globe,
and caused it to be turn'd round violently, in
an engine: by rubbing the hand upon it, it was
illuminated within side, with purple streams.
This gave foreigners the idea of using a glass
globe, in electrical experiments.</p>

<p>The operation of the ethereal fire is various,
nay, infinite, according to its quantity, and degree
of incitement, progress, hindrance, or
furtherance. One degree keeps water fluid,
says the learned bishop of <i>Cloyne</i>: another
turns it into elastic air, and air itself seems nothing
else, but vapors, and exhalations render'd
elastic, by this fire.</p>

<p>This fame fire permeates, and dwells in all
bodies; even diamond, flint, and steel. Its particles
attract with the greatest force, when approximated.
Again, when united, they fly
asunder, with the greatest force, and celerity;
it resists nothing quiescent, but when put into
motion, it disdains all resistance. All this is according
to the laws prescrib'd by the sovereign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2028" id="Page_2028">[2028]</a></span>
architect. This is the life, and soul of action,
and reaction, in the universe. Thus has the
great author provided against the native sluggishness
of matter! light, or fire in animals, is
what we call the animal spirits; and is the author
of life, and motion. But we know not
the immediate mode of muscular motion; any
more than how, in inanimate matter, it causes
the vibrations of an earthquake.</p>

<p>Of this fire, the excellent <i>Manilius</i> thus
writes, who liv'd in the time of <i>Augustus</i>.</p>

<p>13ly, The great question then with us, is
how the surface of the earth is put into that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2029" id="Page_2029">[2029]</a></span>
vibratory and electric state, by heat and driness?
we must needs acquit the internal of the
earth from the charge of these superficial concussions.
How then is the ethereal fire crouded
together, or excited, so as to cause them;
seeing in our ordinary electrical experiments,
we make use of friction?</p>

<p>But that friction alone does not excite electricity,
we know from the obvious experiment
of flint and steel, where the suddenness of the
stroke, and hardness of the matter does it.
Another method of exciting it, is the letting
off a number of great guns, which so crouds
the ethereal fire together, as to electrify glass
windows; observ'd by my friend the reverend
Dr. <i>Stephen Hales</i>. The <i>aurora borealis</i>, <i>australis</i>,
all kind of coruscations, meteors, lightning,
thunder, fire-balls are the effects, and
may reciprocally be the cause of electricity;
but how in particular we know not. Come
we to the animal world, we must needs assert,
that all motion voluntary, involuntary, generation,
even life itself: all the operations of the
vegetable kingdom, and an infinity more of
nature's works, are owing to the activity of this
electric fire, the very soul of the material
world. And in my opinion, 'tis this alone,
that solves the famous question, so much agitated
with the writers in medicine, about the
heat of the blood. How these, how earthquakes
are begun, propagated, we are yet to
seek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2030" id="Page_2030">[2030]</a></span></p>

<p>We may readily enough presume, that the
contact between the electric, and the non-electric,
which gives the snap, and the shock, must
come from without, from the atmosphere.
Perhaps by some meteor that crouds the ethereal
fire together: which then flies off with
that immense force that causes the earthquake.
In the point of contact on the earth's
surface, the same thing is done, perhaps, another
time, by a shower of rain. Our thoughts
upon this matter must needs be as immature,
as they are novel. But we may readily conclude,
that tho' the original stroke comes from
the atmosphere, yet the atmosphere has no further
concern in it: no aereal power, or change
therein, can propagate itself so instantaneously,
over so vast a surface, as 4000 miles square.
Therefore the impetuous rushing noise in the
air, accompanying the shock, is the effect, and
not the cause. And all this is strongly confirm'd
by this observation, that the barometer
and thermometer receiv'd no change upon the
earthquakes.</p>

<p>But surely, there is not a heart of flesh that
is not affected with so stupendous a concussion!
let a man estimate his own power, with that
which causes an earthquake; and he will be
persuaded, that somewhat more than ordinary
is intended by so rare and wonderful a motion.
That great genius <i>Hippocrates</i>, makes the
whole of the animal &#339;conomy to be administred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2031" id="Page_2031">[2031]</a></span>
by what we call nature. And nature
alone, says he, suffices for all things, to animals:
she <i>knows</i> herself, and what is necessary for
them. We must extend this thought to the
inanimate world. And can we deny then, that
he here means a conscious and intelligent nature,
that presides over, and directs all things,
moves the ethereal spirit or fire, that moves all
things: a divine necessity, but a voluntary agent,
who gives the commanding nod, to what we
commonly call nature, the chief instrument
in the most important operations of the vast
machine, as well as in the ordinary ones, particularly
the human one: administring the whole
&#339;conomy (as he says) without noise, unseen,
unfelt. And this leads us,</p>

<p>14ly, Lastly, in regard to the spiritual use we
ought to make of these extraordinary <i>phænomena</i>,
or of our inquiries about them, I shall
first observe, that we find abroad, several of
these earthquakes this year have been very fatal.
In the last we read of, at <i>Philippopoli</i> in <i>Thrace</i>,
the whole city was destroyed, above 4000 inhabitants
killed. At home, where above half a
score separate concussions have been felt, there
has not been one house thrown down, one life
lost. This ought to inspire us with a very serious
reflection about them; nor is it altogether
unworthy of our remark, that they began with
us in <i>London</i>, in <i>february</i> last: and after visiting
the circle of the globe, at present, end with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2032" id="Page_2032">[2032]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly, We may observe, that if we did but
read the works of <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Plato</i> and his
followers; of <i>Tully</i>, <i>Galen</i>, and the like ethic
writers of antiquity; whilst we study, and try
the affections of matter; we should improve in
philosophy, properly speaking: we should lift up
our minds from these earthly wonders, and discern
the celestial admonitions, they present to us.</p>

<p>The original meaning of the word philosophy,
was rightly apply'd to moral wisdom.
We who have advanc'd both the natural, and
moral, should, as the ancients did, join them
both together. By this means, we gather, the
truth of the highest, and most excellent philosophy,
to be found in those volumes of first antiquity,
which we call sacred: and which, 'tis
our peculiar, and inestimable happiness to possess.
We should adore that divine light, which
they hold forth to us. Especially in a country,
where the principles of true religion are open,
and undisguised: where the establish'd profession
of it is rational, noble and lovely: worthy
of the moral governor of the world; fit
for him to enjoin: for us to practise, with
pleasure and effect.</p>
